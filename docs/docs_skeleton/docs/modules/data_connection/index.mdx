# Retrieval

Imagine needing to feed a Language Learning Model (LLM) with user-specific data that isn't part of its training set. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) makes this possible, serving as a bridge to fetch and supply this external data to the LLM during the generation phase.

LangChain provides all the necessary tools to implement RAG applications, catering to all levels of complexity. This section delves into the intricacies of the *retrieval* step. While it may seem straightforward, this process can involve sophisticated complexities and revolves around several key modules.

**[Document Loaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/)**

Document loaders act as the 'gatherers', fetching documents from a multitude of sources. For instance, LangChain's loaders can gather HTML files from private s3 buckets or PDFs from public websites. We offer over 100 different loaders and seamlessly integrate with major providers like AirByte and Unstructured.

**[Document Transformers](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)**

Transformers work as the 'selectors', fetching only the relevant parts of documents. For example, they can split a large code document into smaller, manageable chunks for easier processing. LangChain provides specialized algorithms and logic for this purpose.

**[Text Embedding Models](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/)**

Text embeddings serve as 'capsules' capturing the semantic meaning of text, helping in finding similar text pieces efficiently. For example, they can help find documents related to 'climate change' even if the exact phrase isn't used. LangChain integrates with over 25 embedding providers, offering a standard interface for easy model swapping.

**[Vector Stores](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/)**

Vector stores function as the 'libraries' that efficiently store and search text embeddings. LangChain integrates with over 50 vector stores, from local open-source ones to cloud-hosted proprietary ones, providing a standard interface for easy store swapping.

**[Retrievers](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/)**

Retrievers act as the 'fetchers' that extract the stored data when needed. LangChain supports various retrieval algorithms, such as:
- [Parent Document Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/parent_document_retriever): This allows you to create multiple embeddings per parent document, allowing you to look up smaller chunks but return larger context.
- [Self Query Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query): User questions often contain a reference to something that isn't just semantic but rather expresses some logic that can best be represented as a metadata filter. Self-query allows you to parse out the *semantic* part of a query from other *metadata filters* present in the query.
- [Ensemble Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/ensemble): Sometimes you may want to retrieve documents from multiple different sources, or using multiple different algorithms. The ensemble retriever allows you to easily do this.
