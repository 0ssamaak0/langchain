# AI21 Labs
*Last updated: 2024-01-02*

This page covers how to use the AI21 ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific AI21 wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Get an AI21 api key and set it as an environment variable (`AI21_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an AI21 LLM wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
from langchain_community.llms import AI21
```
