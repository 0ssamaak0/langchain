There are many great tutorials on how to do this, e.g. [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yPBVii7Ct0). We can just use the same code, but use the `DocugamiLoader` for better chunking, instead of loading text or PDF files directly with basic splitting techniques."

    "One issue with large documents is that the correct answer to your question may depend on chunks that are far apart in the document. Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents.\n",

    "For example, if we ask a more complex question that requires the LLM to draw on chunks from different parts of the document, even OpenAI's powerful LLM is unable to answer correctly. In the following example, the chunking of the document does not end up putting the Landlord name and the prepaid in the same context, and instead ends up finding a few other unrelated chunks from other documents not even related to the Menlo Group landlord."
