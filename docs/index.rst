Introduction

Overview
----------------

| **LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:
1. **Data-aware**: Connect a language model to other sources of data
2. **Agentic**: Allow a language model to interact with its environment

| The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.
