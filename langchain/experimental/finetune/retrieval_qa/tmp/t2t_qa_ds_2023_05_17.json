First, I would say as a side point, the winters and summers of AI are greatly exaggerated by Americans and in that, if you look at the publication record of the artificial intelligence community since say the 1950s, you would find a pretty steady growth in advance of ideas and papers. And what's thought of as an AI winter or summer was sort of how much money is the US military pumping into AI, which was meaningful. On the other hand, there was AI going on in Germany, UK and in Japan and in Russia, all\n\nof what most people think of as AI, if you dream of the possibilities of AI, it's really expert systems. And those hit a few walls and there was challenges there. And I think, yes, they will reemerge again with some new breakthroughs and so on. But what did that feel like, both the possibility and the winter that followed the slowdown in research? BG Ah, you know, this whole thing about AI winter is to me a crock. TK Snow winters. BG Because I look at the basic research that was being done in the 80s, which is supposed to be, my God, it was really important. It was laying down things that\n\nthink that everybody has to work in that mode, but I think there's some problems that are hard enough that it's important to have a long research horizon. And I'm worried that we don't incentivize that at all at this point. In this current structure. Yeah. So what do you see as, what are your hopes and fears about the future of AI and continuing on this theme? So AI has gone through a few winters, ups and downs. Do you see another winter of AI coming? Are you more hopeful about making robots work, as you said? I think the cycles are inevitable, but I think each time we get higher, right?

Yeah, I mean, focus protection is always gonna be complicated, especially for something like this that spreads so easily, it's gonna be complicated. And I'm the last person to say it would have been perfect. There would have been people that would have gotten sick, but they got sick anyways. The hope was that if we suppress community spread low enough, we can protect the vulnerable. That was the hope by lockdown. The reality was that only a certain class of people were able to benefit from lockdown.\n\nthe vaccine hesitancy come from in terms of, it seems like, obviously a vaccine is a powerful solution to let us open this thing up. Yeah, so I wrote a Wall Street Journal op ed with Sunetra Gupta in December of last year. Yes. A very night with a very naive title, which says we can end the lockdowns in a month. And the idea is very simple. Vaccinate all vulnerable people and then open up. Open up. Right, and the idea was that the lockdown harms, this is directly related to the Great Barrington Declaration. Great Barrington Declaration said the lockdown harms are devastating to the population\n\nwas 20%, right? So it was incredibly unequal. The lockdowns protected the relatively well off and spread the disease among the poor. So that's in the developing world. In the developed world, the health effects of lockdowns were also quite bad, right? So we've talked already about isolation and depression. There was a study done in July of 2020 that found that one in four young adults seriously considered suicide. Now, suicide rates haven't spiked up so much, but the depths of despair that would lead somebody to seriously consider suicide itself should be a source of great concern in public\n\nQuestion: What was the hope behind the lockdown?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is Bitcoin and why is it difficult for governments to stop people from getting into it?", "answer": "Bitcoin is an alternative currency that is not inflationary and does not have a central authority that can censor it.

And it's likely going to be difficult for governments to stop people from getting into Bitcoin for all of the technical reasons that make it very hard to stop Bitcoin. So then we have this alternative that is Bitcoin, which is not inflationary and does not have a central authority that can censor it. I think gradually is my hope and I also think my most likely scenario, but maybe I am biased because everybody thinks what they want is what's gonna happen. I think we're just gonna witness the same relationship because governments make their currencies so that they can devalue\n\nBitcoin and they haven't been able to stop it. They have tried. They have tried a lot. I wrote a long essay for Quillette on this, like, like why haven't governments been able to stop Bitcoin? And my thesis is essentially that there's been like this mix of different kinds of technical, social and economic and political incentives and disincentives that make it very difficult. And I think to me, the best way to think about it is that Bitcoin is like a Trojan horse. So just to actually tell that story just a little bit, because I think it's important to understand the classical mythology tale, I\n\nI feel like I tried to boil everything that I want to tell you into this five minute video. So there's that. I would recommend that. And then if you're interested in the why have governments not stopped it, which I think is really intriguing, I wrote this long essay in Quillette in February called, you know, why haven't governments banned Bitcoin? And maybe that'll be a helpful guide to some folks. Is this speaking to the Trojan horse idea that there's something enticing about it? Yeah, at the end, it does get into that. But it really also just kind of goes through technically, why is it hard\n\nQuestion: What is Bitcoin and why is it difficult for governments to stop people from getting into it?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is an auto associator and what is it supposed to learn?", "answer": "An auto associator is a type of neural network that learns the identity function, meaning that the output should be the same as the input.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

It just tries to take an input, goes through a set of hidden layers, and comes out with an output. And it's supposed to learn essentially the identity function, that your input is the same as your output. So you think of it as binary numbers. You've got the one, the two, the four, the eight, the 16, and so forth. And so if you want to input 24, you turn on the 16, you turn on the eight. It's like binary one, one, and a bunch of zeros. So I did some experiments in 1998 with the precursors of contemporary deep learning. And what I showed was you could train\n\nit's a very interesting phenomenon. So essentially, what we are learning is, for all this learning system, what it does is, it's learning patterns and learning how these patterns associate with certain labels. So with the glasses, essentially, what we do is that we actually gave the learning system some training points with these glasses inserted, like people actually wearing these glasses in the data sets, and then giving it the label, for example, Putin. And then what the learning system is learning now is, now that these faces are Putin, but the learning system is actually learning that the\n\nattacks are modifications to the digital image. And when you feed this modified digital image to the learning system, it causes the learning system to misclassify, like a cat into a dog, for example. So autonomous driving, of course, it's really important for the vehicle to be able to recognize these traffic signs in real world environments correctly. Otherwise it can, of course, cause really severe consequences. So one natural question is, so one, can these adversarial examples actually exist in the physical world, not just in the digital world? And also in the autonomous driving setting, can\n\nQuestion: What is an auto associator and what is it supposed to learn?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the benefit of having a scripting language like Visual Basic in a mature stack like Microsoft?", "answer": "According to Bill Joy, Mark Andreessen, and the author, having a scripting language like Visual Basic in a mature stack like Microsoft is beneficial because it is useful for scripters, certified public accountants, designers, graphic designers with some programming inclination, and amateurs, while the other language is for component writers who are higher price and more expert.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

There are many different levels here and we can study the cells at the molecular level but also we can use the organoids to ask questions about the properties of the neurons, the\n\nthat there are molecular subtypes of diseases like cancer, where up until that point, it's like, oh, you have breast cancer.

So that was the beginning of this process.

That's going to sound discouraging, probably, to people hearing. But I don't mean it that way. What I mean is that you're coding at a higher level language. Eventually, like, OK, so we're coding in assembly language. That's the beginning, right? You're hardcoded to the architecture. Then you have stuff like C, where it's like, wow, we can abstract across the architecture. We can write code. I can then compile that code for ARM or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there.\n\nwhole source code. Code is, running binary code is more than source code. It's creating object code, it's the linker, it's the loader, it's the how does that interpret it inside of virtual memory space.

Well, the problem, as we mentioned earlier with abstractions is you kind of sometimes assume that whoever implemented this thing had your case in mind\n\nThe C++ optimizers write better machine code than I do. Yes. But I don't think I could appreciate them if I actually didn't understand machine code and machine architecture. At least in my position, I have to understand a bit of it because you mess up the cache and you're off in performance by a factor of 100. It shouldn't be that if you are interested in either performance or the size of the computer you have to deploy. So I would go as a simpler.

I think there's a nature of that window is different in that there was a kind of pacifism and it seems like if war broke out, most nations in the vicinity would not be ready.

A neuron is a processor. It has synapses, even synapses are not transistors, but they are more, they're lower on the information processing hierarchy in a sense. They do a bulk of the computation, but neurons are entire processors in and of themselves that can take in many different kinds of inputs on many different spatial and temporal scales and produce many different kinds of outputs so that they can perform different computations in different contexts.

So I'm using Microsoft Word and Mendeley, and like all of those kinds of things. And I'm being very zen like about the whole process, but it's fascinating. It's a little\n\nAnd so we can just imagine a PDF view on your browser, and then you have annotations on each side. And then when you click on them, a sidebar expands and then you have annotations that support LaTeX and Markdown. And so the idea is that you can, say, explain a tougher part of a paper where there's a step that is not completely obvious. And then you can add more context to it. And then over time, papers can become easier and easier to understand and can evolve in a way. But it really came from myself, Luis, and two other friends. We've had this long running habit of kind of running a journal\n\nQuestion: What is LaTeX?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "Why did BDDs get a bad name?", "answer": "Theoreticians started describing all the things you couldn't do with BDDs.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And so they were getting a bad name because, okay, they were useful, but they didn't solve every problem. I'm sure that the theoreticians are, in the next 10 years, are gonna show why machine learning doesn't solve everything. But I'm not only worried about the worst case, I get a huge delight when I can actually solve a problem that I couldn't solve before. Even though I can't solve the problem that it suggests is a further problem, I know that\n\nproblem that it suggests is a further problem, I know that I'm way better than I was before. And so I found out that BDDs could do all kinds of miraculous things. And so I had to spend quite a few years learning about that territory. So in general, what brings you more pleasure? Proving or showing a worst case analysis of an algorithm or showing a good average case or just showing a good case? That something good, pragmatically can be done with this algorithm. Yeah, I like a good case that is maybe only a million times faster than I was able to do before. But, and not worry about the fact that\n\nFor example, in volume 4A, I was especially surprised when I learned about data structure called BDD, Boolean Decision Diagram. Because I sort of had the feeling that as an old timer, and I've been programming since the 50s, and BDDs weren't invented until 1986. And here comes a brand new idea that revolutionizes the way to represent a Boolean function. And Boolean functions are so basic to all kinds of things in, I mean, logic is, underlies it. Everything we can describe, all of what we know in terms of logic somehow, and propositional logic, I thought that was cut and dried and everything\n\nQuestion: Why did BDDs get a bad name?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What are wave guides?", "answer": "Wave guides are rectangles of insulating material that branch and form different points to target different subregions of a network, and can transition between layers in the third dimension.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Even if you're using electrons for communication, you have these wires where, okay, the size of an electron might be angstroms, but the size of a wire is not angstroms, and if you try and make it narrower, the resistance just goes up, so you don't actually win. To communicate over long distances, you need your wires to be microns wide, and it's the same thing for wave guides. Wave guides are essentially limited by the wavelength of light, and that's gonna be about a micron, so whereas compare that to an axon, the analogous component in the brain, which is 10 nanometers\n\nwire of usually an insulating material. So silicon, silicon nitride, different kinds of glass, just like in a fiber optic, it's glass, silicon dioxide. That makes it a little bit big. We wanna bring these down. So we use different materials like silicon nitride, but basically just imagine a rectangle of some material that just goes and branches, forms different branch points that target different subregions of the network. You can transition between layers of these. So now we're talking about building in the third dimension, which is absolutely crucial. So that's what wave guides are. Yeah,\n\nthat now semiconducting part. So that light source is the semiconducting part of a neuron. And that, so the neuron has reached threshold. It produces a pulse of light. That light then fans out across a network of wave guides to reach all the downstream synaptic terminals that perform this process themselves. So it's probably worth explaining what a network of wave guides is, because a lot of listeners aren't gonna know that. Look up the papers by Jeff Chiles on this one. But basically, light can be guided in a simple, basically wire of usually an insulating material.

You constantly question, you constantly questioning, and maybe truth should be renamed as a process, not a final destination.

I'll say two things about that. One is I was on a panel with Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, last night, and we were talking about this stuff.

Well, I mean, if you wanna make an argument that humans are constrained in what they can understand, I have no issue with that. I think that's right.

It says that quarks, electrons, and all other particles are made up of much tinier strings of vibrating energy. They vibrate in 10 or more dimensions, depending on the flavor of the theory.

That there are some things that they do, for instance, if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees, it doesn't come back towards, it becomes minus what it was.

It seems to be a catalyst for them removing most of the crap. Of seeing that most of what they've been doing is not that important, and really reducing it into saying, like, here's actually the few things that really give meaning. Mortality is a really powerful catalyst for that, it seems like.

It's not as free as it used to be, so this or that. But what's fascinating about Burning Man, someone pointed this out to me, look on the ground, no trash, no cigarettes. The ethic of like picking up your shit there is like so intense. So it's not like the other festivals you go to where there's just trash everywhere, shit scattered everywhere. It's clean. People are picking up their stuff. People are like really being conscious of like not fucking up the playa. So I'm sorry, don't get a burner yapping\n\nclosed off? The answer is they still have to deposit trash, right? That is something from the law of thermodynamics. There must be some production of trash. And, you know, we can still find about them just like investigative journalists going through the trash cans of celebrities in Hollywood, you know. You can learn about the private lives of those celebrities by looking at the trash.

I'm building for you an internal model of a bling. Okay, infants can do this really, really at a young age. And so there's no reason to believe that they couldn't learn emotion categories and concepts in the same way. And what happens when you go to a new culture? When you go to a new culture, you have to do what's called emotion acculturation. So my colleague Bacha Mesquita in Belgium studies emotion acculturation. She studies how, when people move from one culture to another, how do they learn the\n\nancestors, when expressions of emotion were supposed to have evolved, at least by one view of, okay. So, you know, for many years, I was sort of struggling with this set of observations, which is that I feel emotion, and I perceive emotion in other people, but scientists can't find a single marker, a single biomarker, not a single individual measure or pattern of measures that can predict what kind of emotional state they're in. How could that possibly be? How can you possibly make sense of those two things? And through a lot of reading and a lot of an immersing myself in different\n\ngot circuits for anger, sadness, fear. It's interesting that they all have English names, these circuits. But, and they're there and they're triggered by things in the world. And then they cause you to do and say, and so when your fear circuit is triggered, you widen your eyes, you gasp, your heart rate goes up, you prepare to flee or to freeze. And these are modal responses. They're not the only responses that you give, but on average, they're the prototypical responses. That's the view. And that's the view of emotion in the law. That's the view, you know, that emotions are these profoundly\n\nQuestion: What is emotion acculturation?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What can you do to improve your model's accuracy?", "answer": "You can incorporate regularization terms into your learning objective that will essentially tell you not to ask those questions that your model is unable to answer.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

That's a really interesting thought that it makes algorithms more accessible to a different community, a different type of brain. Yep. And that's really interesting because just like literate programming perhaps could make programming more accessible to a certain kind of brain.

I wish that were true, but I know that\n\ndon't try to do any kind of fancy algorithms, just wait for computation to get fast. Do you share this kind of intuition? I think the high level idea makes a lot of sense. I'm not sure that my takeaway would be that we don't need to work on algorithms. I think that my takeaway would be that we should work on general algorithms.

So if the claim is that automated general methods plus data leads to good results, then it\n\nchallenges there? So if worst case analysis shows that an algorithm is always good, that's fine. If worst case analysis is used to show that the problem, that the solution is not always good, then you have to step back and do something else to ask how often will you get a good solution? Just to pause on that for a second, that's so beautifully put because I think we tend to judge algorithms. We throw them in the trash the moment their worst case is shown to be bad. Right, and that's unfortunate. I think a good example is going back to the satisfiability problem.

You can't just change the world on them. And Python three, you know, made some, I think it fixed some things Guido had always hated. I don't think he didn't like the fact that print was a statement.

And so the empathy for the end user as to why they would switch wasn't there. I think also it illustrated just the funding realities. Like Python wasn't funded. Like it was also a project with a bunch of volunteer labor, right? It had more people, so more volunteer labor, but it was still, it was fun in the sense that at least Guido had a job. And I've learned some of the behind the scenes on that now since talking to people who have lived through it and maybe not on\n\nspace. But Python has done a reasonable job in the past, but here is a situation where I think it started to get this pressure where it didn't. I really didn't, I didn't know enough about what happened. I've talked to several people about it. And I know most of the steering committee members today, one person nominated me for that role, but it's the wrong role for me right now, right?

If what you're trying to solve is\n\nof actually we all think of this the same way, which is both powerful and dangerous, right?

They tried to describe physical reality using geometry and principles of geometry and symmetry. Platonic solids, the five solids they had discovered had these beautiful solids. They thought it must be good for some reality. There must be explaining something. They attached one to air, one to fire and so forth. They tried to give physical reality to symmetric objects. These symmetric objects are symmetries of rotation and discrete symmetry groups we call today of rotation group in three dimensions.

Like with Hitler and Stalin, with Hitler, there was an ideology that didn't have anything to do with war underneath it. It was more about conquering. It feels like the Mongols started out more organically, I would say, like this phenomenon started emergently, and they were just like similar to the Native Americans with the Comanches, like the different warrior tribes that Joe Rogan's currently obsessed with, that led\n\nme, because I'm projecting sort of my idea of what it would take to conquer so much land is the ideology is emergent. So if I were to guess, the Mongols started out as exceptionally, as warriors who valued excellence in skill of killing, not even killing, but like the actual practice of war. And you can start out small, and you can grow and grow and grow. And then in order to maintain the stability of the things over which of the conquered lands, you developed a set of ideas with which you can, like you said, establish control, but it was emergent.

So the first thing you look for to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that, because usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash. You see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water, it kicks, the water comes up the sides cause the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that. It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the sides. So you see it and you go, well, there's no, there's no rotor wash. What is that thing?

So the emotion, okay, so the emotion you're saying is imposed back on the human, but I'm asking, do you think there's an algorithm\n\nlike this. If I was gonna be developing real emotional connections with the robot, I would wanna know that this is actually real. It's acting conscious, acting happy because it actually feels it. And I think this is not sci fi. I think it's possible to measure, to come up with tools. After we understand the science of consciousness, you're saying we'll be able to come up with tools that can measure consciousness and definitively say like this thing is experiencing the things it says it's experiencing.

That's going to sound discouraging, probably, to people hearing. But I don't mean it that way. What I mean is that you're coding at a higher level language.

As an economist, one of the things that disappoints me is that as eye popping as these technologies are, you and I are both excited about some of the things they can do.

We actually, believe it or not, have had lower productivity growth in the past\n\nabout the J curve, it could take 10, 20, 30 years for an existing technology to have the kind of profound effects.

And then you have a gigantic tale of journals that have impact factor below 2. And you can really see two economies here. You see the universities that are maybe less prestigious, less known, where the faculty are pressured to just publish papers regardless of the journal.

What I mean by that is for the journals, the articles that get published in Nature, they need to be New York Times grade. So they need to make it to the big media. They need to be captured by the big media.

I think you need to present the case. You say, here, we made good vaccines. Here are the safety profile. Here's the risk benefit balance. And you should decide. You're a smart\n\nto not get vaccinated. I think he represents a lot of people's belief in that.

Right, yeah, this is so important and I'm glad we booked 14 hours for this because. I only have 13, I'm sorry. Okay, so the brain is notoriously complicated. And I think that's an important part of why it can do what it does. But okay, let me try to break it down. Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said\n\ndo things. I'm not sure it's necessary, personally speaking. But if consciousness or any other biological or evolutionary lesson can be repurposed to then influence our next set of algorithms, that is a great way to actually make progress, right? And the same way I try to explain transformers a bit how it feels we operate when we look at text specifically, these insights are very important, right? So there's a distinction between details of how the brain might be doing computation.

So can we send a spacecraft that would be moving at the fraction of the speed of light? And I said, let me look into that for six months. And with my students and postdocs, we arrived to the conclusion that the only technology that can do that is the light sail technology, where you basically produce a very powerful laser beam on Earth. So you can collect sunlight with photovoltaic cells or whatever and then convert it into stored energy and then produce a very powerful laser beam that\n\noff the surface and gives it a push, just like you get a push on a sail on a boat, you know, from the wind reflecting off it. Now, in order for this to be effective, it turns out the object needs to be extremely thin. It turns out it needs to be less than a millimeter thick. Nature does not produce such things.

You basically build up a multiway graph and a proof is a path through the multiway graph that goes from one thing to another thing. The\n\nrule from which all of mathematics arises. The way it works though is a little different from the way things work in sort of a computation because in mathematics, what you're interested in is a proof and the proof says, from here, you can use, from this expression, for example, you can use these axioms to get to this other expression. So that proves these two things are equal. Okay, so we can begin to see how this has been going to work. What's gonna happen is there are paths in metamathematical space.

Yeah, so a distinction between transformers and LSTMs, which were what came before. And there was a transitional period where you could use both.

So in the face of that, what do you think of people like Elon Musk? Because to me, people like that are inspiring and gives you hope in the face of a more kind of pessimistic perspective of our age.

Why do you think his ideas or just ideas of these kinds of deep thinkers in general are labeled as dangerous in our modern world? Is it similar to what you've been discussing that in difficult times, philosophers become dangerous? Or is there something specific about these particular thinkers in our time? Well, I think Jordan Peterson is very anti establishment in a lot of his beliefs. He's\n\nhim well. Jordan was working on his maps of meaning and we were publishing our work. And I think Jordan at the time was concerned about our vague claims to the effect that all meaning is arbitrary. He takes a more Jungian as well as evolutionary view that I don't think is wrong, by the way, which is that there are certain kinds of meanings that are more important, let's say religious types, and that we didn't pay sufficient attention to that in our early days.

Our ego is designed almost to protect this body while we're alive. And you can understand all the good reasons why that is, but it also disconnects us from this bigger reality.

Like what's your sense with OpenCog, with your work, but in general, I was logic based systems and expert systems. For me, always seemed to capture a deep element of intelligence that needs to be there. Like you said, it needs to learn, it needs to be automated somehow, but that seems to be missing from a lot of research currently. So what's your sense? I guess one way to ask this question, what's your sense of what kind of things\n\nthere's something that remembers, there's something that learns. You put a simple version of each thing in there and you connect them all together so that the system will do its thing. So there's a lot of AI in there. There's not any AGI in there. I mean, there's computer vision to recognize people's faces, recognize when someone comes in the room and leaves, trying to recognize whether two people are together or not. I mean, the dialogue system, it's a mix of like hand coded rules with deep neural nets that come up with their own responses. And there's some attempt to have a narrative\n\nQuestion: What is the focus of artificial intelligence in terms of building systems?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the question that has been reduced to whether a small neural network exists that generates the entire content of Wikipedia?", "answer": "Whether such a small neural network exists or not.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

So there's a spectrum between IID, random walk through the space of data, and then there's and what we humans do, I don't even know if we do it optimal, but that might be beyond. So this open question that you raised, where do you think systems, intelligent systems that would be able to deal with this world fall? Can we do pretty well by reading all of Wikipedia, sort of randomly sampling it like language models do? Or do we have to be exceptionally selective and intelligent about which aspects of the world we interact with? So I think this is first an open scientific problem, and\n\nBut they're still neurons, single units communicating with other units, something that is absent in the traditional computer type models of mathematics, reasoning, and so on. So what aspect would you like to see in artificial neural networks added over time as we try to figure out ways to improve them? So one of the main differences and problems in terms of deep learning today, and it's not only deep learning, and the brain, is the need for deep learning techniques to have a lot of labeled examples.

Could you say that certain ideas propagate because they're successful in the meme pool? In a sort of trivial\n\nthings of biology. The idea that culture or maybe ideas, you can really broadly define it, operates under these mechanisms. Even morphology, even anatomy does evolve by memetic means.

If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nbefore mRNA vaccines, we learned that we could use viruses to deliver proteins from a virus that you wanna prevent. And so the Ebola vaccine, we took the spike gene of Ebola virus and put it in a different virus and we deliver that to people and that's called a vector vaccine. And some of the COVID vaccines are vectors of different kinds of most famous are adenovirus vectors carrying the spike gene into the cell. Can you explain how the vector vaccine works again? So we have, we take a virus that will infect humans but will not make you sick. In the case of adenovirus, the years and years of\n\nto kill the tumor, we can target the vector to the tumor specifically in a number of ways. And that makes it less toxic, right? It doesn't infect all your other cells. But it takes time to develop a vector for a particular thing because it requires a deep understanding. Yeah, in fact, we have about a dozen different virus vectors that have been studied for 20 years. And those are the set of vaccine vectors that we're using. So it includes adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, which is a cousin of rabies, but doesn't make people sick. Influenza virus is being used as a vector and even measles\n\nwhich is tough because it's injected. So, okay, so the basic high level, how vaccines work principle is you want to deploy something in the body that's as close to the actual virus as possible, but doesn't do nearly as much harm. And there's like a million, not a million, but there's a bunch of ways you could possibly do that. So those are two ways. And now of course we have modern ways we can make mRNA vaccines, right?

But it can't just be children, because of some of the things I was describing. On the last page of one of them, somewhere tiny in there was this little formula that on the left hand had a sum over all of the natural numbers. It's like one over one to the S plus one over two to the S plus one over three to the S on and on to the infinity. Then on the other side had a product over all of the primes and it was a certain thing had to do with all\n\nnotation in a certain way, but it was only known to a small group of people. And I realized that, in fact, it was very useful to be able to have a notation for something that we don't know exactly what it is, but we only know partial about it. And so instead, so for example, instead of big O notation, let's just take a much simpler notation where I'd say zero or one, or zero, one or two. And suppose that when I had been in high school, we would be allowed to put in the middle of our formula, X plus zero, one or two equals Y, okay?

The fascinating thing about your story, I think it should be truly inspiring to people that want to change the world, is that you don't have a background in programming. You don't have even maybe a technical background. So you saw a problem, you explored different ideas, and\n\nworks on wherever he says he worked, you know, that's not important, but you get access to the technology to try and figure it out. And then you go, well, you know, Bob comes out and says, you know, like we're figuring out these things, but there's a part where our technology isn't advanced enough for us to figure the whole thing out. So then, you know, and let's just say Bob doesn't come out and tell anyone he works on it until he gets to the point where he's stagnated. He's at a, he's at a wall. You go, I can't do it. You know, sometimes the best thing is to bring in a fresh mind.

But one of the definers in complex systems is that no matter how you model the complex system, it will still have some emergent behavior not predicted by the model. Can you elaborate on the complex versus the complicated? Complicated means we can fully explicate the phase space of all the things that it can do. We can program it. All human, not all, for the most part, human built things are complicated. They\n\nevolving over time, the definition of a complex versus, and this is another Schmackt and Berger thing, a complex versus a complicated system. A complicated system can be sort of broken down into bits and pieces, a complicated system can be sort of broken down into bits, understood and then put back together. A complex system is kind of like a black box. It does all this crazy stuff, but if you take it apart, you can't put it back together again, because there's all these intricacies. And also very importantly, like there's some of the parts, sorry, the sum of the whole is much greater than the\n\nwhich is, that the physics of complex systems is at least as badly understood as the physics of phase coherence in quantum mechanics. Can we go there for a second? You've talked about attractor networks, and just maybe you could say what are attractor networks, and more broadly, what are interesting network dynamics that emerge in these or other complex systems? You have to be willing to think in a huge number of dimensions, because in a huge number of dimensions, the behavior of a system can be thought as just the motion of a point over time in this huge number of dimensions.

Maybe you can linger and say in this context, what do you mean by computation and communication? What are electrons, what is light and why do they excel at those two tasks? Yeah, just to first speak to computation versus communication, I would say computation is essentially taking in some information, performing operations on that information and producing new, hopefully more useful information. So for example, imagine you have a picture in front of you and there is a key in it and that's what you're looking for, for whatever reason,\n\nside of things, a neuron is not a transistor. A neuron is a processor. It has synapses, even synapses are not transistors, but they are more, they're lower on the information processing hierarchy in a sense. They do a bulk of the computation, but neurons are entire processors in and of themselves that can take in many different kinds of inputs on many different spatial and temporal scales and produce many different kinds of outputs so that they can perform different computations in different contexts. So this is where enters this distinction between computation and communication.

Well, if you take the video with the radar going, no, there's actually other things out there because there's at least 60 people that have seen these things on radar off the VACAPES. It actually became, I called a buddy of mine who was running the wing at the time, the fighter wing. I said, dude, what are you guys doing about this?

And you know, so they send out a NOTAM again and they, they do a, what's called a hazard report that says, Hey, there's these objects out there. We almost hit one here and that gets sent off to the Naval safety center. What was done? I mean, what are you going to do? Can you catch one, go out\n\nthe warning area.

Those electrons, they don't just flow perfectly without dissipation. If an electron collides with an imperfection in the lattice or another electron, it's gonna slow down, it's gonna lose its momentum. So you have to keep applying that voltage in order to keep the current flowing. In a superconductor, something different happens. If you get a current to start flowing, it will continue to flow indefinitely. There's no dissipation. So that's crazy. How does that happen? Well, it happens at low\n\nmuch scratching the surface of superconductivity. There's very deep and rich physics there, just probably not the main subject we need to go into right now. But it turns out that when you have this material, you can do usual things like make wires out of it so you can get current to flow in a straight line on a chip, but you can also make other devices that perform different kinds of operations.

A hypergraph is like a graph, but links can go between more than two nodes. So you have a link between three nodes. And in fact, OpenCog's atom space would properly be called a metagraph because you can have links pointing to links, or you could have links pointing to whole subgraphs, right?

But I don't think it was yet a technical term when we started calling this a generalized hypergraph. But in any case,\n\nof what, there's this idea, there is this hypergraph, it represents space, and it represents everything that's in space. The features of that hypergraph, you can say certain features in this part we do know, certain features of the hypergraph represent the presence of energy, for example, or the presence of mass or momentum, and we know what the features of the hypergraph that represent those things are, but it's all just the same hypergraph. So one thing you might ask is, you know, if you just look at this hypergraph and you say, and we're gonna talk about sort of what the hypergraph does,\n\nunobvious when you started off with saying, we've got this graph, it's being updated in time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that just looks like nothing to do with special relativity. And yet you get that. And what, I mean, then the thing, I mean, this was stuff that I figured out back in the 1990s. The next big thing you get is general relativity. And so in this hypergraph, the sort of limiting structure, when you have a very big hypergraph, you can think of as being just like, you know, water seems continuous on a large scale.

And the bigger question to ask, even in the context of your, uh, tic tac encounter is, uh, what do you think is the meaning of this, uh, thing we got going on here? The meaning of life, human life in this sense. So let me start with, have I pondered my own mortality? Yes. Very often. And I don't get into my religious beliefs or what I am, but I will tell you that I do believe in God.\n\nMost people didn't agree. I don't myself agree with this teleological view, but it is at least a beautiful speculative view of the cosmos. What do you think people experience? What do they seek when they believe in God from this kind of perspective? I'm not an expert on thinking about God and religion. I'm not myself religious at all. When people sort of pray, communicate with God, which whatever form, I'm not speaking to sort of the practices and the rituals of religion. I mean the actual experience of that people really have a deep connection with God in some cases. What do you think that\n\nthere's, if life is defined by many deaths that continue on, and then I wonder if there's something persists beyond in this, that, yeah, there is something that still persists, I wonder. Okay, so that. Now, you know, obviously there's so many different answers to this question that are religious, and ranging from like the most absurd shit you ever heard in your life, like the gold. You're gonna get a mansion. There's gold streets. Like, I don't, do you want like gold streets? Who offers gold streets? I know about the virgins, but there's a bunch of virgins. The Christians give you the gold\n\nQuestion: What is the speaker's opinion on the different religious answers to the question of life after death?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the speaker's opinion on the evolution of the human brain?", "answer": "The speaker believes that the evolution of the human brain is a work in progress and wonders about the features that evolution is playing with to create the new brain.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And so from that comes perhaps a different take on that behavior, or maybe I can justify it scientifically in some sort of way. I also look at humanity in general, and I am amazed by what we can do and the kind of ideas that we can come up with. And I cannot stop thinking about how the brain is continuing to evolve. I don't know if you do this, but I think about the next brain sometimes. Where are we going with this? Like,\n\nnext brain sometimes. Where are we going with this? Like, what are the features of this brain that evolution is really playing with to get us in the future, the new brain? It's not over, right? It's a work in progress. So let me just a quick comment on that. Do you think there's a lot of fascination and hope for artificial intelligence of creating artificial brains? You said the next brain. When you imagine over a period of a thousand years, the evolution of the human brain, do you sometimes envisioning that future see an artificial one, artificial intelligence, as it is hoped by many, not\n\nand the ancestor brains that it came from? Yeah, I think it depends on how far back you want to go. You go all the way back, right, in your book. So what's the interesting comparison, would you say? Well, first of all, I wouldn't say that the human brain is the fanciest brain we've got. I mean, an octopus brain is pretty different and pretty fancy, and they can do some pretty amazing things that we cannot do. You know, we can't grow back limbs, we can't change color and texture, we can't comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves into a little crevice.

Can we backtrack on the kind of, is this graph designed, is it in general supposed to be sparse and the operations constantly grow and change the graph?\n\neasier. I mean, OpenCog is still a research system. So it takes some expertise to, and sometimes, we have tutorials, but it's somewhat cognitively labor intensive to get up to speed on OpenCog. And I mean, what's one of the things we hope to change with the true AGI OpenCog 2.0 version is just make the learning curve more similar to TensorFlow or Torch or something.

And so that's a very different processing model than, say, the matrix multiplication based model as underlies most deep learning systems, right? So you could create an agent that just factored numbers for a billion years. It would run within the OpenCog platform, but it would be pointless, right? I mean, the point of doing OpenCog is because you want to make agents that are cooperating via reading and writing into this weighted labeled hypergraph, right?

It's like as big as a pizza and it has maybe a thousand processors on it. And then you dice that up using a saw. And now you can sell these things so cheap because the manufacturing process was so streamlined. I think a technology as revolutionary as silicon microelectronics has to have that kind of manufacturing scalability, which I will just emphasize, I believe is enabled by physics. It's not, I mean, of course there's human ingenuity that goes into it, but at least from my side where I sit, it\n\nit smaller? And even if you do, do you still continue to get performance improvements? But that's another kind of scaling where these companies have been able to... So, okay, you picture a chip that has a processor on it. Well, that chip is not made as a chip. It's made on a wafer. And using photolithography, you basically print the same pattern on different dyes all across the wafer, multiple layers, tens, probably a hundred some layers in a mature foundry process. And you do this on ever bigger wafers too. That's another aspect of scaling that's occurred in the last several decades. So now\n\ndimension in the sense that entire wafers need to be stacked on top of each other with fiber optic communication between them, and we need to be able to fill a space the size of this table with stacked wafers, and that's when you can get to some 10 billion neurons like your human brain, and I don't think that's specific to the optoelectronic approach that we're taking. I think that applies to any hardware where you're trying to reach commensurate scale and complexity as the human brain. So you need that fractal stacking, so stacking on the wafer, and stacking of the wafers, and then whatever\n\nQuestion: What is the size of a 300 millimeter wafer and how many processors does it have?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What does traveling faster than the speed of light according to relativity entail?", "answer": "Traveling faster than the speed of light according to relativity seems to entail communication backwards in time.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Well, I mean, to travel faster than our current spaceships could travel, you wouldn't need to find any bug in the universe, right? The known laws of physics, you know, let us go much faster up to the speed of light, right? And, you know, when people want to go faster than the speed of light, well, we actually know something about what that would entail, namely that, you know, according to relativity, that seems to entail communication backwards in time.\n\nrelativity allows for wormholes. They technically can exist. Do you think those can ever be leveraged by humans to travel fast in the speed of light? Well, the wormhole thing is debatable. The, we currently do not know of any means of going faster than the speed of light. There is like, there are some ideas about having space. Like so, you can only move at the speed of light through space, but if you can make space itself move, that's like, that's warping space. Space is capable of moving faster than the speed of light. Right. Like the universe in the Big Bang, the universe expanded at much,\n\na half times the speed of light. It's still just the speed of light. And to make that work, you have to change your view of how space and time work to be able to account for the fact that when you're going faster, it appears that length is foreshortened and time is dilated and things like this. And that's special relativity. That's special relativity. So then Einstein went on with sort of vaguely similar kinds of thinking. In 1915, invented general relativity, which is the theory of gravity.

So here is where the sort of the recipe, I mean, hasn't changed too much. There is a transformer model that's the kind of recurrent neural network that essentially takes a sequence of modalities, observations that could be words, could be vision or could be actions. And then its own objective that you train it to do when you train it is to predict what the next anything is. And anything means what's the next action. If this sequence that I'm showing you to train is a sequence of actions and\n\nto do clearly. But that's kind of what the Gato is, is this brain that essentially you give it any sequence of these observations and modalities and it outputs the next step. And then off you go, you feed the next step into and predict the next one and so on. Now, it is more than a language model because even though you can chat with Gato, like you can chat with Chinchilla or Flamingo, it also is an agent, right? So that's why we call it A of Gato, like the letter A and also it's general. It's not an agent that's been trained to be good at only StarCraft or only Atari or only Go.

So one of the leaps forward and what took the team a lot of effort and time was, as you were asking, how has gato been trained? So I told you gato is this transformer neural network, models actions, sequences of actions, words, et cetera.

Some dimensions are more beautiful than others. Once you have an actual understanding of what actually happens in those dimensions in our physical world, as opposed to sort of all the possible things that could happen. In some sense, I mean, just the basic fact is you need to get rid of them. We don't see them. So you need to somehow explain them. The main thing you're trying to do is to explain why we're not seeing them. And so you have to come up with some theory of these extra dimensions and how\n\nSo if the dimension were too big, they would miss each other, they wouldn't be able to expand. So in order to expand, they have to find each other and three of them can find each other and those can expand and the other one will be stuck. So that explains why within string theory, these particular dimensions are really big and full of exciting stuff. That could be an explanation. That's a model we suggested with my colleague Brandenberger. But it turns out to be related to a deep piece of math. You see, for mathematicians, manifolds of dimension bigger than four are simple. Four dimension is\n\nWe should be surprised because we could have conceived of universes with our pre dimension. Why is it that we have such a small dimension? That's number one. So good theory of the universe should give you an intuition of the why it's four or three plus one. And it's not obvious that it should be. That should be explained. We take that as an assumption, but that's a thing that should be explained. Yeah, so we haven't explained that in string theory.

With the new kind of science in the\n\nalong the line of implementations and experiments and so on? There's a couple of different stages to this. I mean, one is the think about the world computationally. Can we use programs instead of equations to make models of the world? That's something that I got interested in in the beginning of the 1980s. I did a bunch of computer experiments. When I first did them, I didn't really, I could see some significance to them, but it took me a few years to really say, wow, there's a big important phenomenon here that lets sort of complex things arise from very simple programs. That kind of happened\n\narise from very simple programs. That kind of happened back in 1984 or so. Then, you know, a bunch of other years go by, then I start actually doing a lot of much more systematic computer experiments and things and find out that the, you know, this phenomenon that I could only have said occurs in one particular case is actually something incredibly general. And then that led me to this thing called principle of computational equivalence. And that was a long story.

It's interesting that it's not just philosophy that might lead you in this direction, but there are ways of thinking quasi scientifically that lead you there too. But maybe it's different than panpsychism. What do you think? So Alan Watts has this quote that I'd like to ask you about. The quote is, through our eyes, the universe is perceiving itself. Through our ears, the universe is listening to its harmonies. We are the witnesses through which the universe becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence. So that's not panpsychism.

He likes, he basically endorses a panpsychist view where you get consciousness with the degree of information processing or integrated information processing in a simple, in a system and even very, very simple systems, like a couple of particles will have some degree of this. So he ends up with some degree of consciousness in all matter. And the claim is that this theory can actually explain a bunch of stuff about the connection between the brain and consciousness.

They're like, yeah, but I work on a team and all they use\n\nus in? Or is it the expectation? Yeah, right, right. Because it's not, I think we've seen this through a personal will or failure lens recently. Like, oh, am I addicted to email? I have bad etiquette about my email. No, it's the underlying workflow. So the tool itself I will exonerate. I think I would rather use POP3 than a fax protocol. I think it's easier. The issue is the hyperactive hive mind workflow. So if I am now collaborating with 20 or 30 different people with back and forth unscheduled messaging, I have to tend those conversations, right? It's like you have 30 metaphorical ping pong\n\nwhile. I think all that's fine. I mean, that's email at its best. Where it starts to kill us is where all of our collaboration is happening with the back and forth. So when you've moved the bulk of that out of your inbox, now you're back in that Meg Ryan movie, like You Got Mail, where it's like, all right, load this up and you wait for the boat and be like, oh, we got a message. Yeah, Lex sent me a message. This is interesting, right? You're back to the AOL days.

So one thing I've heard before, I don't know if this is based on any actual study. This might be like a total fictional anecdote of numbers, but it rings in the mind as being true. You remember about 10% of what you read, you remember about 20% of what you listen to, you remember about 70% of what you actively interact with in some way, and then about 90% of what you teach. This is a thing I heard again, those numbers might be meaningless, but they ring true, don't they, right? I'm willing to say I learned\n\nring true, don't they, right? I'm willing to say I learned nine times better if I'm teaching something than reading. That might even be a low ball, right?

Outside of family and friends, is there a moment you can remember that you would like to relive because it made you truly happy or it was transformative in some fundamental way? A moment that was transformative. Or made you truly happy? Yeah, I think there's times, like music used to be a much bigger part of my life than it is now,\n\nof the times, I really believe that the framework that we have to expose ourselves to be talking to us when we were an expert, when we were taking that class and we knew everything about quantum mechanics. And then six months later, you don't remember half of the things. How could we make it easier to have those conversations between you and your past expert self? I think there might be, it's an under explored idea. I think notes on paper are probably not the best way. I'm not sure if it's a combination of video, audio, where it's like you have a guided framework that you follow to extract\n\nQuestion: According to the anecdote mentioned in the text, what percentage of information do you remember when you teach it?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the researcher's goal in creating a biologically realistic neural network?", "answer": "To make a large scale, truly biologically realistic neural network by putting a differential equation for a biologically realistic neuron in hardware on the chip.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Now, what's been done so far is not like that. So I guess personally, as a researcher, I mean, I've done a bunch of work in computational neuroscience where I did some work with IARPA in DC, Intelligence Advanced Research Project Agency. We were looking at how do you make a biologically realistic simulation of seven different parts of the brain cooperating with\n\nof neurons. Whereas before we would have been limited to tens, a hundred, something like that. And just like simulating quantum mechanical systems with a quantum computer. So the goal here is to understand such systems. For me, the goal is to study this as a scientific physical system. I'm not drawn towards turning this into an enterprise at this point. I feel short term applications that obviously make a lot of money is not necessarily a curiosity driver for you at the moment. Absolutely not. If you're interested in short term making money, go with deep learning, use silicon microelectronics.\n\nthat. So like, what are you gonna do with this particular neuromorphic machine? So suppose what we're trying to do with it is build something that thinks. We're not trying to get it to make us any money or drive a car. Maybe we'll be able to do that, but that's not our goal. Our goal is to see if we can get the same types of behaviors that we observe in our own brain. And by behaviors in this sense, what I mean the behaviors of the components, the neurons, the network, that kind of stuff. I think there's another element that I didn't really hit on that you also have to build into this.

In the automotive sector, for some reason, it's not as much. This is obviously the problem that Ford and GM are struggling with. It's like, they're really good at making cars at scale cheap. And they're like legit good. Like Toyota at this, they're some of the greatest manufacturing people in the world, right? That's incredible. But then when it comes to hiring software people, they're horrible. So it's culture. And then it's such a difficult thing for them to sort of embrace, but greatness\n\non it. That's what I view as the central tenet of modern software development. That's fascinating that you put it that way. So I work and I build autonomous vehicles.

And the idea was that sometimes the world has become so overwhelmed with bureaucracy or corruption or just stagnation that somebody has to come in or some group of people or some force has to come in and do the equivalent of a forest fire to clear out all the dead wood so that the forest itself can be rejuvenated and society can then move forward.

I reread it after that, because there was a lot of weird things with little formal systems in there that were hard for me at the time. But that was the first book I read that gave me a feeling for AI as like a practical academic or engineering discipline that people were working in. Because before I read Gordalesh or Bach, I was into AI from the point of view of a science fiction fan.

So I should figure out how to build a spacecraft traveling close to the speed of light, go far away, then\n\nabout AI, I can say that, is I read G\u00f6del Escher Bach when I was in high school. That was pretty formative for me because it exposed the interestingness of primitives and combination and how you can make complex things out of simple parts and ideas of AI and what kinds of programs might generate intelligent behavior.

Yeah, the robots came because my first job, so I finished an undergraduate degree in philosophy at Stanford and was about to finish a master's in computer science. And I got hired at SRI in their AI lab and\n\nI was in 12th grade, I got my hands on a PDF copy in Romania of Russell Norvig, AI modern approach. I didn't know anything about AI at that point. I was, you know, I had watched the movie, The Matrix was my exposure.

You can't run an exponentially growing linear materials economy on a finite planet forever. That's not a hard thing to figure out. And it has to be exponential if there's an exponentiation in the monetary supply because of interest and then fractional reserve banking and to then be able to keep up with the growing monetary supply, you have to have growth of goods and services.

So it's really in the most general setting. Extensive form games. And that's kind of what the AI community has been working on and being benchmarked on with this Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem. Can you describe extensive form games? What's the model here? Yeah, so if you're familiar with the tree form, so it's really the tree form. Like in chess, there's a search tree. Versus a matrix. Versus a matrix, yeah. And the matrix is called the matrix form or bi matrix form or normal form game. And here\n\nof what's going on. Then if you move up from just repeated, simple repeated matrix games, not all the way to extensive form games, but in between, they're stochastic games, where, you know, there's these, you think about it like these little matrix games. And when you take an action and your opponent takes an action, they determine not which next state I'm going to, next game I'm going to, but the distribution over next games where I might be going to. So that's the stochastic game. But it's like matrix games, repeated stochastic games, extensive form games. That is from less to more general.\n\nmatrix form or bi matrix form or normal form game. And here you have the tree form. So you can actually do certain types of reasoning there that you lose the information when you go to normal form. There's a certain form of equivalence. Like if you go from tree form and you say it, every possible contingency plan is a strategy. Then I can actually go back to the normal form, but I lose some information from the lack of sequentiality. Then the multiplayer versus two player distinction is an important one.

So why is it that as human beings, we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water, whereas we pay thousands of dollars for a few grams of diamonds. Why is this the case? Do we value water less than diamond? The answer is no, but at the margin where we are right now, you live in a place where water is very abundant because cities are only built in places where water is abundant. And you're only making a choice about the next unit of water. And so water is extremely abundant\n\nme for the rest of my life. You're choosing about the next unit right now at this point, at this stage. And if you analyze economic decision making at the margin, it makes a lot more sense and you can understand why people decide and make the decisions that they do. Whereas if you don't apply marginal analysis, things don't make sense. The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve is what is called the water diamond paradox. So you will die without water.

Now we're divided within communities, within families, within gerrymandered voting districts and precincts, right? So you can't disengage. We're stuck with each other. So if there's a civil war now, for lack of a better word, what it might seem like is the late 1960s, early 1970s, where you had the bombings and let's call it domestic terrorism and things like that, because that would seem to be something that once again, you don't even need a large chunk of the country pulling apart. 10% of people who think it's the end times can do the damage. Just like we\n\nbecause until recently the answer was zero. And so the fact that it's not zero should deeply, deeply scare us all and we should devote a lot of energy to making it zero again. And that's how I feel about the risk of a civil war in the U.S. and that's how I feel about the risk of nuclear war is it's higher than it used to be and that should terrify us all. To me what terrifies me is that all this kind of stuff seems to happen like overnight like super quick and it escalates super quick when it happens. So it's not like I don't know what I imagine but it just happens like if a nuclear war\n\nQuestion: What is the reason why we can't have the same kind of civil war as before?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What made the speaker decide to create an iOS app?", "answer": "The speaker realized that kids these days are always on their phone and wanted users to be able to express passing thoughts in class or in the dining hall.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And I realized it should be an iOS app. And so that was a decision. But I knew kids these days, they're always on their phone. And I wanted you to be able to say a passing thought in class. You're walking around, and you have a thought, and you can express it. Or you're in the dining hall, and you have your phone out, you can express it.

We also are now available on Android, but we'll get there, for the new Android users from MIT,\n\nthen I'm also going to acknowledge that just having an app doesn't make it useful because that's actually maybe the easy part. If you know what I mean, there's like all of this stuff about rollout adoption and awareness, but let's focus on the app part first. So that's again, why I said the team is incredible. So we have a bunch of people who, let's just say that the technology that we use to make it is not the standard way you make an app. If you think about a standard iOS app or Android app, those are a user interface that contacts a web server and sends some information back and forth.\n\nthey ran into was, when you program things on iOS, iOS is very good at making it hard to do things in the background. And so there was quite a lot of effort required to go and make this thing work. So the whole point, this thing would run in the background and iOS, I mean, most Android probably as well, right? But yeah, iOS certainly makes it difficult for something to run in the background, especially when it's eating up your battery, right? Well, we wanted to make sure we didn't eat up the battery. So that one we can, we actually are very proud of the fact that ours uses very little battery.\n\nQuestion: What made the speaker decide to create an iOS app?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What did the chair of the math department at Princeton ask Perelman after his lecture?", "answer": "He asked Perelman if he would like to join the faculty at Princeton and requested his resume.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

So there's a very clinical look at the war. Meaning there is a man and a country, Vladimir Putin, that makes a claim on a land, builds up troops and invades. The way to avoid suffering there and the way to avoid death and a way to avoid war is to back down and basically let, there's a list of interests he provides and you go along with that.

So what this means is the future, so first of all, we have all of the problems I mentioned, but also it means that the future becomes much more uncertain. So you're far less likely to provide for yourself 10 years from now, far less likely to find an easy way to give yourself value 10 years from now. And so you become more short termist. And that is reflected economically in a lower savings rate and we see savings rates decline, but it is also reflected in all manners of decision making.

So like an incredibly, I think it's in, it might be even the sixties, but I think it's the seventies. So when he was really young and then he went on to do like incredible work with his book and yeah, with tech that people don't know. And going back just on the reason why we ended up, because I think this is interesting. The reason why we ended up using the name Fermat's Library, this was because of Fermat's Last Theorem. And Fermat's Last Theorem is actually a funny story. So Pierre de Fermat, he was like a lawyer and he wrote like on a book\n\nQuestion: What did the person dedicate their 1985 Turing Award lecture to?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What are some indications that were observed during the experiment with baby monkeys?", "answer": "During the experiment, the monkeys saw the blue gloves of the technicians that were giving them milk, and some of the cells in the brain area associated with face recognition became hand sensitive instead.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

It'd be interesting if a variant of that experiment would show a different kind of pattern associated with food than a face pattern, whether that could stick. There are indications that during that experiment, what the monkeys saw quite often were the blue gloves of the technicians that were giving to the baby monkeys the milk. And some of the cells, instead of being face sensitive in that area, are hand sensitive. That's fascinating. Can you talk about what are the different parts of the brain and, in\n\nare you born with that? Or you just is designed to learn that quickly, like the face of the mother and so on? My hunch, my bias was the second one, learned very quickly. And it turns out that Marge Livingstone at Harvard has done some amazing experiments in which she raised baby monkeys, depriving them of faces during the first weeks of life. So they see technicians, but the technician have a mask. Yes. And so when they looked at the area in the brain of these monkeys that were usually defined faces, they found no face preference. So my guess is that what evolution does in this case is there\n\nOne is what innate knowledge or mechanisms, or what have you, people or other animals might be endowed with. I always like showing this video of a baby ibex climbing down a mountain. That baby ibex, a few hours after its birth, knows how to climb down a mountain. That means that it knows, not consciously, something about its own body and physics and 3D geometry and all of this kind of stuff. So there's one question about what does biology give its creatures and what has evolved in our brains? How is that represented in our brains? The question I thought about in the book The Birth of the Mind.\n\nQuestion: What are some indications that were observed during the experiment with baby monkeys?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the Teal fellowship and who is eligible for it?", "answer": "The Teal fellowship is a program for young people who are already smart and don't need to go to college.

And you're right, it was a very important result because we had just locked the world down in middle of March with, I think, catastrophic results. And if that study was right, if our study was right, that meant we'd made a mistake. And not because the death rate was low, that's actually not the key thing there. The key thing is that we had adopted these policies, these test and trace policies, these policies, these lockdown policies aimed at suppressing the virus level to close to zero. That was essentially the idea. If we can just get the virus to go away, we won't\n\nhave to let the virus go through the entire population in some way or some other? We can talk about that in a bit. That's the Great Barrington Declaration. You don't have to let the virus go through the population. You can shield preferentially. The policy we chose was to shield preferentially the laptop class, the set of people who could work from home without losing their job. And we did a very good job at protecting them. Well, let me take a small tangent. We're gonna jump around in time, which I think will be the best way to tell the story. So that was the beginning. Yeah, okay, actually,\n\nbe a good idea, like hardcore lockdown for a future virus that's 10 times deadlier, but spreads at the same rate as COVID? Or maybe another way to ask that is imagine a virus that's 10 times deadlier, what's the right response? I mean, I think it's always gonna be focus protection, but the group that needs the focus protection may change depending on the biology of the virus, right? So the polio epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the US, the great, the people at most risk were children. We didn't know really at the beginning there was this fecal oral spread.

And yet it seems that however you break it apart, maybe from an economics perspective, that they're not growing currently. And so that's where a lot of our troubles are at.

So to you, ultimately the reason to go through that difficult process is because it feels damn good to have your hand raised? There is that. There is also the fact that\n\nknows that before every fight, when the guy from the UFC goes and Steppen Maroon says, St. Pierre, you're up next, I always take a few minutes to do that same rehearsal. And I tell myself I'm going to win this fight because I'm better and I'm very cocky about myself. I'm telling all the reasons that I'm going to win. I got a better team. I made more sacrifice, you know, I'm faster, I'm more powerful, way more athletic. My fighting IQ is better than him. I got a strategy on point that he's never going to be able to keep up with and this and that. And I was telling myself, I'm going to show\n\nthat training and mixed martial art give me. However, I do not like the feeling of uncertainty, the stress that I have, not knowing if I will be badly injured or humiliated or winning the fight. To me, I'm bearable and that's what takes the most out of me. More than brain damage, more than anything. That's what takes the most out of me. But the thing you get from it is the freedom that you get because of the money, but because of the celebrity, because of everything that comes with it. So you can be the best version of yourself because of fighting. But at the same time, you've said that,\n\nQuestion: What motivates Mr. George St. Pierre more in his fighting career?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What did the person invite Skye to do?", "answer": "The person invited Skye to come with him to volunteer as a surgeon on the Syrian border.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Like no one's going to, no one wants to download an app during finals period, a social app during finals period. But I emailed a few people. I was like, you know, can I sleep on your floor?

So, because he then contacted me later and said, Skye, I am going back to the Syrian border to volunteer as a surgeon, do you want to come with me? That was an easy one. That's probably the easiest one I could give you. But it came out of this interesting moment, very personal moment, right? Lifeboat and Hunger Ward are completely different. And I had to really work hard to gain access to those stories. So you intentionally thought like what, I want to get access to the story. And then what are the different\n\njust the summer before, that summer, and he invited me to come to this small conference where he was inviting me and Sunetra Gupta, who is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Harvard, sorry, at Oxford University.

And this woman who was a really respected soldier, she specializes in anti tank missiles.\n\nbecause I've read accounts from Red Army soldiers and they're very patriotic, right? But a lot of that patriotism comes through years later as part of the nostalgia and the remembering. When you're down at that front 100 yards, it is often boiled down to a very small world. So your grandfather, was it your grandfather? Grandfather. At the machine gun, he's concerned about his position and his comrades and the people who he owes a responsibility to.

When did you first fall in love with robotics or even computer science more in general? Computer science first at a fairly young age, then robotics happened much later. I think my first interesting introduction to computers was in the late 80s when we got our first computer, I think it was an IBM, I think IBM AT. Those things that had like a turbo button in the front, the radio precedent, you know, make, make the thing goes faster. Did that already have floppy disks? Yeah.\n\nworks. But here was technology. I didn't have that word when I was five or six. And the magic was still there for you? The magic was still there, even if you knew how it worked. So I became totally interested in this and then went around, collected little pieces of mechanical objects from bicycles, from broken radios. I would go through the neighborhood. This was an era where you would allow five or six year olds to run through the neighborhood and do this. We don't do that anymore. But I didn't know how to put them together.

But let's ignore that for a second. We can come to that later. But is it useful to talk about observation? Not yet. Not yet. It's so great.

If you're a small insurgency organization, people can run away and then you can't promise to shoot them very easily because you don't control all the territory.

How are we doing what we're doing? And obviously, from a\n\nit creates might be bigger problems. And you can say, well, but then that's the new problem and humanity will innovate its way out of that. Well, I don't think that's paying attention to the fact that we can't keep up with exponential curves like that, nor do finite spaces allow exponential externalities forever. And this is why a lot of the smartest people thinking about this are thinking, well, no, I think we're totally screwed unless we can make a benevolent AI singleton that rules all of us.

If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nJust the difference being that this is Luke Roloff's view, all of the drafts are conscious. So I guess for Dennett, there's sort of no fact of the matter about which of these drafts is the correct one. On Roloff's view, maybe there's no fact of the matter about which of these drafts is my consciousness, but nonetheless, all the drafts correspond to some consciousness. And I mean, it just sounds kind of funny. I guess I think he calls it Dennettian panpsychism. But Luke is one of the most rigorous and serious philosophers alive at the moment, I think. And I hate having Luke Roloff's in an\n\nof as consciousness. Somehow the editing is consciousness of this, of this story. I mean, that's a theory of consciousness, isn't it? The narrative theory of consciousness or the multiple versions editing, collaborative editing of a narrative theory of consciousness. Yeah, he calls it the multiple drafts model. Incidentally, there's a very interesting paper just come out by very good philosopher Luke Roloff's defending a panpsychist version of Dennett's multiple drafts model.

And so, you know, the enlightenment ideal is to follow the evidence and the arguments where they lead. But it's kind of very hard for human beings to do that. I think we get stuck in some conception of how we think science ought to look.

We're actually studying it a little bit in my lab here at MIT, but I also think it's just a really urgent question to answer.

And, you know, there's strategies to approach that, but nonetheless, it's a phenomena. And sometimes, so I love complex numbers and I love to raise, so I looked at Python. And then I had the experience, I did some stuff in Python and I was just doing my PhD. So I was out, my focus was on, I was actually doing a combination of MRI and ultrasound and looking at a phenomenon called elastography, which is you push waves into the body and observe those waves, like you can actually measure them. And then you do mathematical inversion to\n\nQuestion: What problem was the speaker trying to solve with both ultrasound and MRI?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is a spacesuit?", "answer": "A spacesuit is a shrunken spacecraft that has all the same systems, including communication, and is designed to provide a person with oxygen to breathe, scrub out their carbon dioxide, and a pressure environment to live in.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nA spacesuit is the world's smallest spacecraft. So I really, that's the best definition I can give you. Right now we fly gas pressurized suits, but think of developing and designing an entire spacecraft. So then you take all those systems and you shrink them around a person, provide them with oxygen to breathe, scrub out their carbon dioxide, you know, make sure they have pressure. They need a pressure environment to live in. So really the spacesuit is a shrunken, you know, spacecraft in its entirety, has all the same systems. Communication as well, probably. Yeah, communications, exactly. So\n\nI put a spacesuit on them that goes from the skin out? So rather than a gas pressurized shrinking that spacecraft around the person, say, here's how humans perform, can I design a spacesuit literally from the skin out? And that's what we've come up with, a mechanical counter pressure, some patterning, and that way it could be order of magnitude less in terms of the mass, and it should provide maximum mobility for moon or Mars. What's mechanical counter pressure? Like how the heck can you even begin to create something that's tight fitting and still doesn't protect you from the elements and so\n\nbut technically it's feasible. So we do a lot of work in the materials. You know, what materials do we need to pressurize someone? What's the patterning we need? That's what our patents are in, the patterning, kind of how we apply. This is a third of an atmosphere. Just to sort of take a little step back, you have this incredible biosuit where it's tight fitting, so it allows more mobility and so on.

If you ask even some simple questions, you have to take very delicate singular limits in order to get the correct answer, and you have to take them from the right direction, otherwise it doesn't work.

So you have to take a square root. Now square root usually has a plus or minus sign when you take it.

But the short version of it is that what people have found when you try and write down a quantum theory, that it's often a good idea to take your time coordinate, whatever you're using to your time coordinate, and multiply it by the square root of minus one and to make it purely imaginary.

No, a circle is what we mean by a perfectly round form. It's not on the table to be revised. And so I would say the same thing about consciousness. It's just like saying, is there some breakthrough that would get us to realize that consciousness is really an illusion? I'm saying no, because the experience of an illusion is as much a demonstration of what I'm calling consciousness as anything else, right? That is consciousness. With free will, it's a similar problem.\n\nto you is the connection between free will and consciousness and is free will an illusion or not? Good question. So I think we need to be a lot more agnostic about free will than about consciousness because I don't think we have the kind of certainty of the existence of free will that we do have in the consciousness case. It could turn out that free will is an illusion. It feels as though we're free when we're really not.

So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy, so it basically says the airplane can fly as slow as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs, force of gravity, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then based on the airfoil design and everything else and how it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, because it's really\n\num, so let's start with the A6. The A6 was really an analog airplane, uh, that was built in the sixties. All right.

So I was stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington. So you've got the Cascades and incredible amount of time. And we would get in the simulators because unlike normally people think terrain following and there's the radars, the 111, the B1 has a system like this, but it'll, the radar can see and it'll fly.\n\nis that just deep down some instinct that you develop as a pilot over time?

So that's a benefit. The con is you go, you're letting drivers use it basically anywhere. So anyway, that could detect lanes with confidence. Was there a philosophy, uh, design decisions that were challenging that were being made there or from the very beginning, was that, uh, done on purpose with intent?

And these young people would go out and distribute pamphlets and many of them got their heads cut off with guillotines for their trouble.

Then I put in my other number on my piece of paper, added the two\n\nthe total market. It's a different creature. So if I was in business and I was producing a good or service and I was saving up enough money that I started to be able to invest that money and gain interest or do things like that, I start realizing I'm making more money on my money than I'm making on producing the goods and services. So I stop even paying attention to goods and services and start paying attention to making money on money and how do I utilize capital to create more capital. And capital gives me more optionality because I can buy anything with it than a particular good or service\n\ncharities and I was impressed by just how much money they managed to get out of selling some of these coins. So I probably could have done better by just talking more with the traders and actually ensuring that they can do a better job of maximizing the value of all of them. But it was a very stressful time and I did have to act quickly. Like I did manage to make a lot of the donations before, a few days before the great crypto crash happened. So it was, it's difficult to, obviously there's parallel universes in which I did better, but at the same time, there's also lots of parallel universes\n\nQuestion: What did the speaker do when they realized the value of their assets?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the temperature required for the operation of hybrid heterogeneous systems with superconducting detectors and optoelectronic integration?", "answer": "Everything has to be at four Kelvin.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Therefore, we should expect our universe to be optimized, have its physical parameters optimized to make very large numbers of stars because that's how you make black holes and black holes make offspring. So we expect the physics of our universe to have evolved to maximize fecundity, the number of offspring. And\n\nYou know, we live in a big universe, okay? There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera.

And then they would go back and keep doing the same thing about not sleeping enough. And then I realized you can't really speak about the good things that happen. It's like the news, what bleeds leads. And if you speak about the alarmingly bad things that happen, people tend to have a behavioral change.

It had that really excellent gate oxide that allowed us to make MOSFETs, these high performance transistors, so quickly and cheaply and easily without having to do a lot of materials development. The band gap of silicon is actually, so in a semiconductor there's an important parameter which is called the band gap which tells you there are sort of electrons that fill up to one level in the energy diagram and then there's a gap where electrons aren't allowed to have an energy in a certain range and then there's another energy level above\n\nnot interfere with each other in such a way that you could still have gates. Like that's enabled. To achieve that scale, spatial and temporal, it seems to be very special and is enabled by the physics of our world. All of the things you just said. So starting with the silicon material itself, silicon is a unique semiconductor. It has essentially ideal properties for making a specific kind of transistor that's extraordinarily useful. So I mentioned that silicon has, well, when you make a transistor, you have this gate contact that sits on top of the conduction channel. And depending on the\n\nbetween those two, you can cause electrical current to flow between them. Now we add a third terminal up on top there, and depending on the voltage between the left and right terminal and that third voltage, you can change that current. So what's commonly done in digital electronic circuits is to leave a fixed voltage from left to right, and then change that voltage that's applied at what's called the gate, the gate of the transistor.

Science of government was the term of art. Think about what that means,\n\nabout we should fear fear itself. He was a president or something. I vaguely remember that. So I'm worried about both sides here, that. Well, I think the general principle is that should not be a tool of public policy, right? The public policy should attempt, and public health policy in particular, should attempt to address that fear. It's not that you should tell people lies, of course not. Tell people accurately what the risk is. Give people tools that have evidence that they can address their risk with and level with people when we don't know.

When she said that, you know, that economics has reached the point where most money is made, not by actually making stuff, you know, you use money to make money.

Well, that's just preventing bread producers from producing a lot of bread. And that's just making the problem worse.

As a result, we start outstripping the environment and extincting species following stone tools and going and becoming apex predator everywhere. This is why we can't keep applying apex predator theories because we're not an apex\n\nwe can then genetically engineer different creatures. We can extinct species. We can devastate whole ecosystems.

I think it was in 20, around 2013, maybe that we've, that became very clear and we made that pivot and also became very clear and that it's either the way you go building a driver assist system is, you know, fundamentally different from how you go building a fully driverless vehicle. So, you know, we've pivoted towards the ladder and that's what we've been working on ever since. And so that was around 2013, then there's sequence of really meaningful for us really important defining milestones since then. And in 2015, we had our first, actually the world's first\n\nto produce a ufunc like that early on in 2009 or something like that, 2010. They didn't work that well. It was kind of pretty bulky. But in 2012, Peter and I had just started Anaconda. We had, I just, I'd learned to raise money. That's a different topic, but I'd learned to raise money from friends, family, and fools, as they say. And. That's a good line. Oh, that's a good line. But, so we were trying to do something. We were trying to change the world. Peter and I are super ambitious.

So there was already a meaning to strong AI, which was complexly different, but related, right? So we were tossing around on an email list whether what title it should be. And so we talked about narrow AI, broad AI, wide AI, narrow AI, general AI. And I think it was either Shane Legge or Peter Vos on the private email discussion we had.

But we figured gay\n\ntitle, but I never loved it because in the end, I was doing some, what we would now call narrow AI as well, like applying machine learning to genomics data or chat data for sentiment analysis. I mean, that work is real. And in a sense, it's really AI. It's just a different kind of AI.

But secondly, strong AI was used in the cognitive science literature to mean the hypothesis that digital computer AIs could have true consciousness like human\n\na really important question because I think we're very far from artificial general intelligence, which is AI that can just do the full breadth of what humans can do. But we do have human level or superhuman level narrow intelligence, narrow artificial intelligence. And obviously my calculator can do math a lot better than I can. And there's a lot of other things that machines can do better than I can. So which is which? We actually set out to address that question with Tom Mitchell.

Well, there's illusionism about the external world and illusionism about consciousness. And these might go in different. Illusionism about the external world kind of takes you back to Descartes. And yeah, could all this be produced by an evil demon? Descartes himself also had the dream argument. He said, how do you know you're not dreaming right now?

I\n\nto talk with people about any of their concerns, but if you start getting into the stuff that just isn't true, then we have a problem. The thing I struggle with is conspiracy theories, whatever language you want to use, but sort of ideas that challenge the mainstream quote unquote narrative, given our current social media and internet, like the way it operates, they can become viral much easier. There's something much more compelling about them. Like I have a secret about the way things really work. That becomes viral, and that's very frustrating, because then you're not having a conversation\n\nQuestion: What is the author's opinion on vaccine conspiracies?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the basic principle of virology?", "answer": "The basic principle of virology is the study of viruses.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

We can then jump around all over the place. What are the basic principles of virology? Maybe a good place to start is what is a virus? That's great. I mean, I talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes before I get to that. But, and I wonder if I should put it up front, but it's kind of a boring definition. So if you do that first, people will turn off. So first you tell them about all the millions and billions of viruses around. So a virus, we have a very specific definition because it's different\n\nSo it's pretty complicated. And I mean, understanding all of this is really useful for trying to figure out like developing a vaccine or some kind of drug to attack, any aspects of this, right? So, I mean, there are many different implications to that. First of all, it's important to understand the virus itself, right? So in order to understand how it acts, what is the overall mechanistic process of this virus replication, of this virus proliferation to the cell, right? So that's one aspect. The other aspect is designing new treatments. So one of the possible treatments is designing\n\nsome genes and you could learn principles from that, how the virus might do that. Sure, I think everything is broadly applicable. So to say it's not useful to study viruses of insects and plants is just wrong because in science, we probably know this, maybe in your field it's the same. If you're curious, you're going to run into interesting things that you never planned on, right? That's why people like, you can criticize, why do we want to go on Mars?

And I'm a scientist and certainly from the science standpoint, I'll go over that. But I actually think that really the most important thing is probably the business people that I work with. And when I look back at the companies that have done well, it's been because we've had great business people. And when they haven't done as well, we haven't had as good business people. But from a science standpoint, I think about\n\nscore. Well, I'm gonna have to try to come up with some kind of device that everyone would want to use, maybe to make coffee, cause coffee seems to be the prevalent performance enhancing chemical that everyone uses. So I'll have to think about those kinds of metrics. Yeah, but you see that's just giving an idea of I guess what I found meaningful in general, like whether or not it's like, whether or not that quadratic thing is important or not. The general idea was I wanted to do things that would outlast me. And that was what inspired me and that's just how I choose what problems to work on.\n\nis because you may have seen, I found some simple way to solve quadratic equations that is easier than every textbook. So my score might already be not bad, which is why I decided then let's change it into the number of hours in the lifetimes as well. So the way I was doing it before is that if a person was sort of remembering or using or appreciating what I had done for like 10 years of their life. Oh, I see. That would count as 10. I see. So if there was one person who for 10 years remembered or appreciated something I did, that counts as a score of 10 and we add up overall people.

So from that perspective, I think, yes, in terms of how far are we from the original vision? I can't reveal that, but it's, that's why I have done a fun at work because every day we go in and thinking like, these are the new set of challenges to solve. Yeah, that's a great way to do great engineering as you think of the press release. I like that idea actually. Maybe we'll talk about it a bit later, but it's just a super nice way to have a focus.

I want there to be some kind of aha moment in there. And then hopefully the script can revolve around some kind of aha moment.

On rare occasions, I would get a chance to sneak into his classroom and observe him. And I think he was at his best in the classroom. I think he really came to life and had fun, not only teaching, but engaging in chit chat with the students and ingratiating himself with the students. And what I inherited from that is the great desire to be a teacher. I retired recently and a lot of my former students came, students with whom I had done research or who had read my papers or who had been in my classes.

Right, well, I could agree to that because Bobby Fischer said in one of his books, which I actually love what he said. He said, every game of chess is a draw. Yeah. The only way somebody win is when one of us makes a mistake. I mean, it doesn't get any better than that. Yeah, it doesn't. What is chess? Like, how do you think about chess? What's at the core of your interest in chess? Do you see Kung Fu, music, film, all of it, life, all just living through chess? Yeah, I see, it's the most stimulating passage of time for me that's also, it's like, it's a pastime that stimulates my mind,\n\nat all. It's just, it's fun.

So do whatever, if you're into getting better at chess, do whatever it takes to actually just the number of hours you spend a day thinking about chess, maximize that. If you're like super serious about it. I actually get very addicted whenever I start studying chess, which is why I don't do it as seriously when I'm focused on content. Cause I go through these rabbit holes where if I'm focusing on chess, I wanna be as good as I possibly can\n\nreally where the learning is. And it's the same thing if you want to go back to chess, you know, when you start off, you try and learn because you're remembering what you're doing. If you play against someone, I'm always a big place, play with someone better than you. That's how you learn. If you're constantly beating people, you're not learning anything. You're just learning that they're not good and you're better. When you challenge yourself against someone that is better than you, you learn.

And then you say, okay, all those who didn't get better, who volunteers to get this new treatment? And then you give\n\nsome bias. We know from theory of machine learning, the only way to cut down the sample complexity is to kind of cut down, somehow cut down the hypothesis space. You can do that by building in bias. There's all kinds of reasons to think that nature built bias into humans. Um, convolution is a bias, right? It's a very strong bias and it's a very critical bias. So my own view is that we should look for more things that are like convolution, but the address other aspects of reasoning, right? So convolution helps us a lot with a certain kind of spatial reasoning. That's quite close to the imaging.\n\nwho volunteers to get this new treatment? And then you give them the new treatment, but the people that volunteer are more likely to wanna get better. They're not representative sample of everybody that has.

So this now gets to something more like Buddha said, right, which was desire is the cause of suffering. Gerard and Buddha would kind of agree in this\n\ncomes from matters and if the doing comes from a fullness of being, it's inherently going to be paying attention to externalities or it's more oriented to do that than if it comes from some emptiness that is trying to get full in some way that is willing to cause sacrifices other places and where a chunk of its attention is internally focused.

John Michael Jaray, he's an incredible synth genius. But anyway, so I finally got my like gall up enough to show it to my dad one day after work. And I got very little of my dad because there were nine kids and he worked from 8 a.m. till 6 p.m. We'll come home very tired. And\n\nare they in life? I don't know if all that, like, great writers, I'm sure, would say, why don't you just write? You don't need all that. But that's, for me, that's my process. Well, I'm not so sure about that. I bet you quite a lot of writers have created a world in their mind before they even put the simplest of words down. So yeah, there's quite a lot to that. Yeah. What's your favorite song to play? Is there some favorite ones you go to? But both play and kind of, I'm sure you love singing. Oh, no, no, no. No, you don't? I'm not, I'm neither talented nor do I have the desire.

And I just have to kind of look back over time spans and remember that every single time I have got through it and remind myself that it is just temporary. And that has been the most helpful thing for me because I just try to combat the scariest thing about it. And then believe, have faith that it's gonna, like this will go away.

I can't quite put it into words, but of my position and what I've been given, I've been given so much. And it showed me this thing from when I was young and explained to me why I am where I am now. And I, to this day, it did not feel like myself telling myself that. That's the only way I can explain it. And there was a lot more that it showed me and that was incredibly healing for me. But just to be like, to put it into a short thing because there's so much to this. It felt, I walked away feeling very convinced that there is more to be known, for sure.\n\noh, I've been holding these things in that I don't wanna tell anybody, and then I tell this person, and oh, there's relief in that. But that's really not where the real work comes from. I think the real work is meeting with someone who is well versed and educated and understands. It's like coding. It really is, it's like someone who, they listen to you, and they're like, well, that was a trigger, and then this became this trigger, and you're probably, every time you're hearing that, thinking of this thing that happened earlier in your life, and they just will walk you through scenarios, and\n\nQuestion: What has been the most helpful thing for the speaker when dealing with their overwhelming feeling?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the speaker's opinion on animators?", "answer": "The speaker has a lot of respect for animators and thinks their work is crazy when you see it.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

There was a, Anki had a robot called Cosmo where they put in some of these animations. That part is easy, right? The hard part is doing it not via these kind of handcrafted behaviors, but doing it generally autonomously. Like I want robots, I don't work on, just to clarify, I don't, I used to work a lot on this. I don't work on that quite as much these days,\n\nsee them work, but they lose themselves in the craftsmanship of it, in the rhythm of it.

And when you're cutting like a few seconds of animation, that was someone's like month, maybe, you know? And like, they understand, but still it's like, whoa, it's brutal. And so they have like this zen outlook on it, which is really cool.

Or could be that we could have silicon devices that are conscious, or up to statement like everything has some degree of consciousness and some more than others. This is like Giulio Tonioni and phi. We just recently talked to Christoph Koch. OK. Christoph was my first graduate student. Do you think it's important to illuminate aspects of consciousness in order to engineer intelligence systems? Do you think an intelligent system would ultimately have consciousness? Are they interlinked? Most of the people\n\nconsciousness into AI systems is a possibility, is something that we might one day do, or is there something fundamental to consciousness that is, is there something about consciousness that is fundamental to humans and humans only? I think it's possible. I think both consciousness and intelligence are information processing. Certain types of information processing. And that fundamentally, it doesn't matter whether the information is processed by carbon atoms in the neurons and brains or by silicon atoms and so on in our technology. Some people disagree. This is what I think as a physicist.\n\nSo basically. I don't think this is what makes you conscious, but I do think being puzzled about consciousness is a very good sign that a system is conscious. So if I encountered a robot that actually seemed to be genuinely puzzled by its own mental states and saying, yeah, I have all these weird experiences and I don't see how to explain them. I know I'm just a set of silicon circuits, but I don't see how that would give you my consciousness. I would at least take that as some evidence that there's some consciousness going on there. I don't think a system needs to be puzzled about\n\nQuestion: Is it possible for silicon devices to be conscious?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the author's opinion on the usefulness of something in an exam versus in creating technology that could change human civilization?", "answer": "The author thinks that something may not be good on an exam, but it is good when creating technology that could change human civilization.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nBut it's not good on an exam, but it is good when you're coming up with technology that could change the fabric of human civilization. But there is, you know, in my neck of the woods of artificial intelligence, there's a lot of trajectories one can imagine of creating very powerful beings, the technology that's essentially, you know, you can call super intelligence that could achieve space exploration, all those kinds of things without consciousness, without something that to us humans looks like consciousness. And there, you know, there is a sad feeling I have that consciousness too, in terms\n\nresponsible for saving hundreds of millions of lives, make our lives possible and good. So in terms of where I would like to find myself with these two different notions of achievement, I don't know what I would more like to achieve. I have an inclination that it will be something scientific because I would like to bring meaning to humanity instead of sustenance, but I think both are very important. We can't sustain our lives if we don't keep growing technologically. I think people like you are making that possible with computing because that's one of the few things that's really moving\n\nsorts of things have been very valuable in development of culture and indirectly even of technology. But of course, without the technology there, it was all some quite abstract thinking. So now we're at a time in history when a lot of these ideas can be made real, which is amazing and scary, right? It's kind of interesting to think, what do you think Nietzsche would do if he was born a century later or transported through time? What do you think he would say about AI? I mean. Well, those are quite different. If he's born a century later or transported through time.

So you know, like we would take the airplanes up to 50,000 feet when we had to do full the maintenance check flights on them. So when you're doing 200, you know, in some odd knots, it's actually slow for the airplane. It's, you know, you're getting, you know, it's kind of like, it's not, you know, there's maneuvering speeds. You know that if I hit a certain speed in a Super Hornet, that I have the full capability of the airfoil. If I'm below that speed, I'm going to stall the airfoil before I get to the maximum G. Okay? So when you look at something like that, you go, well, is it\n\ngoing from 35,000 feet down to 20,000 feet in a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane, because the human brain thinks we really are. We like to be flat. I see what you mean. We think 2d. So if I'm fighting, how you really get an advantage when you're fighting another airplane is to work in the vertical, because most people will do like one move in the vertical and then they want to start to flatten out because that's where we're comfortable. Yeah. So they're profound. Do you still think in like stacks of 2d layers or no, or do you, do you truly start to think in that third dimension,\n\nto go in the top and out the bottom. So and I'm just against basically a vertical displacement of the airplane. So I'm going from high to low. It's very, very tight and it doesn't in about roughly about 2,500 feet, give or take a little. So you go, that is, that is a really tight vertical turn. Yeah. For example, the a six in order to do that was about 9,000 feet. And we look at a building that's 2000 feet high and think that is tall. Right. All right. So in, in aviation sense, when you're starting to do vertical displacement numbers going from 35,000 feet down to 20,000 feet in a matter of\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of taking airplanes up to 50,000 feet?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the difference between the author's relationship with creating music and playing music publicly?", "answer": "The author's relationship with creating music is like a dance, while playing music publicly creates anxiety due to the competitive aspect.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And it's something you work with, because my relationship with my guitar was like, it was something to tame and defeat. Yeah, it's a challenge. Which was kind of what my whole personality was back then. I was just very like, as I said, very competitive, very just like must bend this thing to my will.

I mean, it's just this bi directional thing that happens. And music and sports were kind of my first loves. And yeah, it's very difficult to describe, I think accurately, because it's like no other feeling. Musically, how is it different than playing in a garage with the band by yourself practicing? Like, do you feel like you're creating something different when you got the guitar and the amp and just the sound\n\nnot developing the part of your brain that I think requires you to generate beautiful music. It is ultimately technical in nature. And so that took me a long time to let go of that and just be able to write music myself. And that's a different journey, I think. I think that journey is a little bit more inspired in the blues world, for example, where improvisation is more valued, obviously in jazz and so on. But I think ultimately it's a more rewarding journey because you get your relationship with the guitar then becomes a kind of escape from the world where you can create, I mean, creating\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between the author's relationship with creating music and playing music publicly?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What tool did the speaker use to draw the surface?", "answer": "The speaker used a grapher built into OSX for the 3D stuff to draw the surface.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Most people believe that way, except if you present a death of anybody they care about or love, they find that extremely depressing.

I mean, it's like, again, for the Soviet Union, Chernobyl meltdown, there was always the ability, I believe, to have a kill switch. The problem is, the more power you give to the machine, the more opportunity you give to the human supervising that machine to make a mistake and not shut off the switch at the right time.

There should be good protocols, good leadership, good execution, competency all around. Your protocols should consider the basic failures of human nature, the human factor of how things go wrong.

Yeah. And that's why, like I said, and like you just said, you have protocols in place that are a kill switch. And if you think about the amount of nuclear weapons that\n\nthese issues are very complicated and that in a lot of these cases, it's you can't really make that call, like not even as a legislator.

Or like they're going to always protect the driver because who's going to buy a car if it's programmed to kill someone? Yeah. Kill you instead of someone else.

So then the electron versus light distinction and why are electrons good at computation and light good at communication? Yes, there's a lot that goes into it I guess but just try to speak to the simplest part of it. Electrons interact strongly with one another. They're charged particles. So if I pile a bunch of them over here they're feeling a certain amount of force and they wanna move somewhere else. They're strongly interactive. You can also get them to sit still. You can, an electron has a mass so you can cause it to be spatially localized. So for\n\nat computation while light is excellent for communication.

I think when times are not difficult, the people with the greatest power are usually the people who are very creative, generating a lot, and that really requires ideation or philosophy of some sort. I think when times become stagnant, the important successful people become the people who are very good at protecting their own pieces of the pie and taking others. I think that those people have to be very opposed to any sort of thinking that could restructure society or conventions about who\n\npoem over and over again, but yes, how to... Let's return back. Okay. So the rest of the argument goes, you learn to want what other people want, therefore fundamental conflict based in our desire because we want the thing that somebody else has. And then people are in conflict over trying to get the same stuff, power, status, attention, physical stuff, a mate, whatever it is. And then we learn the conflict by watching. And so then the conflict becomes metic. And we become on the Palestinian side or the Israeli side or the communist or capitalist side or the left or right politically or\n\nQuestion: What does the author believe is the meta cause of conflict in all of human history?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the author's opinion on the effects of a nuclear war?", "answer": "The author believes that although a nuclear war may have devastating effects, life will still find a way to go on.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

One way that you can encode information in quantum states of light is in the number of photons. You can have what are called number states and a number state will have a well defined number of photons and maybe the output of your quantum computation encodes its information in the number of photons that are generated. So if you have a detector that is sensitive to that, it's extremely useful. Can you achieve like a clock with photons or is that not important? Is there a synchronicity here? In\n\na mass so you can cause it to be spatially localized. So for computation that's useful because now I can make these little devices that put a bunch of electrons over here and then I change the state of a gate like I've been describing, put a different voltage on this gate and now I move the electrons over here.

So\n\nthis idea of cosmological natural selection, because I think that is one of the core ideas that could change our understanding of how the universe got here, our role in it, what technology is doing here. But there's a couple more pieces that need to be set up first. So the beginning of our universe is largely accepted to be the big bang. And what that means is if you look back in time by looking far away in space, you see that everything used to be at one point and it expanded away from there.

I mean, you could tell when somebody is full of shit and somebody is not really genuinely enjoying the success of his friends. That was weird to me. That was interesting. And I mean, the way you're kind of speaking to it, the reason Joe stood out to me is I guess I haven't witnessed genuine expression of that often in this culture of just real joy for others. I mean, part of that has to do, there hasn't been many channels where you can watch or listen to people being their authentic selves. So I'm sure there's\n\nyourself in life. It's really easy to look in the mirror and wish you looked different, wish you were more successful like that person over there, wish that, you know, wish a lot of things. And people that I see that really succeed at life really succeed truly. And that doesn't mean they're making money necessarily or they're succeeding. And, you know, they're talking to a lot of people like their success, success to me is like happy and real, they have real self love.

Do you see the brain as a bunch of different modules, and they together come in the human brain to create intelligence? Or is it all one mush of the same kind of fundamental architecture? Yeah, that's an important question. And there was a phase in neuroscience back in the 1950 or so in which it was believed for a while that the brain was equipotential. This was the term. You could cut out a piece, and nothing special happened apart a little bit less performance.\n\nrepaint the view of the brain as less glamorous, I suppose, than you would otherwise think. Or like, I guess you draw a thread that connects all brains together in terms of homeostasis and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I wouldn't say that the human brain is any less miraculous than anybody else would say. I just think that there are other brain structures which are also miraculous. And I also think that there are a number of things about the human brain which we share with other vertebrates, other animals with backbones. But that we share these miraculous things. But we can do some things in\n\nand the ancestor brains that it came from? Yeah, I think it depends on how far back you want to go. You go all the way back, right, in your book. So what's the interesting comparison, would you say? Well, first of all, I wouldn't say that the human brain is the fanciest brain we've got. I mean, an octopus brain is pretty different and pretty fancy, and they can do some pretty amazing things that we cannot do. You know, we can't grow back limbs, we can't change color and texture, we can't comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves into a little crevice.

And definitely I've evaluated a lot of patients with a heart transplant. It does work pretty well. The mechanical heart substitutes are also advancing quite rapidly these days.

And then finally, there's immunosuppressive drugs, which will suppress the immune response. That's right now what's done, say, for a liver transplant. The fact that this whole thing works is fascinating, at least from my outside perspective. Will we one day be able to regenerate any organ or part of the human body? Any of you? I mean, it's exciting to think about future possibilities of tissue engineering. Do you see some tissues more difficult than others? What are the possibilities here? Yeah, well, of course, I'm an optimist. And I also feel\n\nNot that you can completely get rid of it and it'll appear again, but when pieces of it are removed or injured, it does regenerate itself pretty amazingly. So I'd say the kidneys, the fact that there are more around, also it's, you know, the kidney is a smaller organ. It's often just, you don't have to put a transplanted kidney where the kidney should be in the back of the abdomen. You can just kind of stuff it into the pelvis there because it's a smaller organ.

The reason why you cannot say one person, one vote is because you need some kind of like authority or some kind of mechanism to say who the humans are.

That's a, well, it's math in the sense that it's game theory. So you have to come up with incentive, it's mechanism design.

And it seems like the core first principle idea of the Mongols is just to be excellent warriors. That felt to me like the starting point. It wasn't some ideology. Like with Hitler and Stalin, with Hitler, there was an ideology that didn't have anything to do with war underneath it. It was more about conquering. It feels like the Mongols started out more organically, I would say, like this phenomenon started emergently, and they were just like similar to the Native Americans with the Comanches, like the different warrior tribes that Joe Rogan's currently obsessed with, that led\n\nme, because I'm projecting sort of my idea of what it would take to conquer so much land is the ideology is emergent. So if I were to guess, the Mongols started out as exceptionally, as warriors who valued excellence in skill of killing, not even killing, but like the actual practice of war. And you can start out small, and you can grow and grow and grow.

He lost enthusiasm with physics and doing physics problems. And there was one time when he was in the cafeteria of Cornell, and he saw a guy that was throwing plates in the air. And he noticed that when the plate was in the air, there were two movements there. The plate was wobbling, but he also noticed that the Cornell symbol was rotating. And he was able to figure out the equations of motions of those plates. And that led him to kind of think a little bit about electron orbits in relativity, which led to the paper about quantum electrodynamics.\n\nthat when I started doing research in physics, at the time I was doing theoretical physics. And a lot of it, you still have the beauty, but it's very different. So I had to actually do a lot of the simulation. So essentially I was actually writing, in some cases writing fortune code. Good old fortune, yeah. To actually, right, do simulations and so on. That was not exactly what I enjoyed doing. And also at the time from talking with the senior students, senior students in the program, I realized many of the students actually were going off to like Wall Street and so on. So, and I've always\n\nI pick problems is very characteristic of physics and of an intellectual background which is not psychology, which is not chemistry and so on and so on. Yeah, both of your parents are physicists. Both of my parents were physicists and the real thing I got out of that was a feeling that the world is an understandable place and if you do enough experiments and think about what they mean and structure things so you can do the mathematics of the, relevant to the experiments, you ought to be able to understand how things work. But that was, that was a few years ago. Did you change your mind at all\n\nQuestion: What did the speaker have to do when they started doing research in physics?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the purpose of adding small pieces of neural networks to the language model?", "answer": "To add the ability to see", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nfroze them. We said, these don't change. We train them to be very good at predicting the next word. It's a very good language model, state of the art at the time you release it, et cetera, et cetera. We're going to add a capability to see, right? We are going to add the ability to see to this language model. So we're going to attach small pieces of neural networks at the right places in the model. It's almost like I'm injecting the network with some weights and some substructures in a good way, right? So you need the research to say, what is effective? How do you add this capability without\n\nBut they're still neurons, single units communicating with other units, something that is absent in the traditional computer type models of mathematics, reasoning, and so on. So what aspect would you like to see in artificial neural networks added over time as we try to figure out ways to improve them? So one of the main differences and problems in terms of deep learning today, and it's not only deep learning, and the brain, is the need for deep learning techniques to have a lot of labeled examples. For instance, for ImageNet, you have like a training set, which is 1 million images, each one\n\nway to do few shot promptings through language on language only domain. And then in the last two years, we've seen these expanded to beyond language, adding vision, adding actions and games, lots of progress to be had. But this is maybe, if you ask me like about how are we gonna crack this problem? This is perhaps one way in which you have a single model. The problem of this model is it's hard to grow in weights or capacity, but the model is certainly so powerful that you can teach it some tasks, right? In this way that I teach you, I could teach you a new task now, if we were all at a text\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of adding small pieces of neural networks to the language model?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "According to the text, how does capital influence human behavior?", "answer": "Capital ends up being a way to influence human behavior, where people still feel free in some meaningful way.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

But the market is this invisible thing I can't put an agent on so it feels like free. And so if you want to affect people's behavior and still have them feel free, capital ends up being a way to do that. But I think affecting their attention is even deeper because if I can affect their attention, I can both affect what they want and what they believe and what they feel. And we statistically know this very clearly. Facebook has done studies that based on changing the feed, it can change beliefs, emotional dispositions, et cetera. And so I think there's a way that the\n\nin which economic servitude was just more profitable than slavery, right? Have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead and nobody has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever. This is a cynical take but a meaningful take. So people \u2013 so capital ends up being a way to influence human behavior, right? And yet where people still feel free in some meaningful way. They're not feeling like they're going to be punished by the state if they don't do something. It's like punished by the market via homelessness or something. But the market is this invisible\n\nI get to that, I get back to this point. The way to critique capitalism, if it's gone bad, is to get better capitalists. Free markets where they're not fair should be made fair. Never decide that the answer is the thing that has never produced any human flourishing, i.e. Marxism. So as you describe in The Madness of Crowds the herd like behavior of humans that gets us into trouble, you as an individual thinker and others listening to this, how can you, because all of us are mids crowds, we're influenced by the society that's around us, by the people that's around us.

To me, there just seems to be some game theoretic dance combined with the fact that people's life is at stake. And then when people die at the hands of a robot, the reaction is going to be much more complicated. So all of that, but that's still an open question. And the cool thing is all of these companies are struggling with this question of how difficult is it to solve this problem sufficiently such that we can build a business on top of it and have a product that's going to make a huge amount of money and compete with the manually driven vehicles. And so their teleoperation\n\ndrivers do that we see as super easy and as it would have been characterized 10 years ago, routine, and it's not for a computer, right? It turns out to be something that we do naturally that is sort of cutting edge, right? Computer science. So on the teleoperation question, I think this is a more interesting one than people would like to sort of let on, I think, publicly. There are gonna be problems, right? And this is one of the complexities of sort of putting these things out in the world. And if you see the real world of trucking, you realize, wow, it's rough. There are dirt lots, there's\n\nthe manually driven vehicles. And so their teleoperation from Starsky's is really interesting idea. How much can, I mean, there's a few autonomous vehicle companies that tried to integrate teleoperation in the picture. Can we reduce some of the costs while still having reliability, like catch when the vehicle fails by having teleoperation? It's an open question. So that's for you scenario number two is to use teleoperation as part of the picture. Yeah, let me follow up on that question of how hard driving is, because this becomes a big question for researchers who are thinking about labor\n\nQuestion: What is the complexity of putting teleoperation out in the world?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "Who is Jacob Fox and how does the speaker know him?", "answer": "Jacob Fox is a famous researcher at Stanford and the speaker knows him because they were both grad students together at the same time.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

This is something that I learned from another friend of mine. He's a very famous researcher. All these people are more famous than I am. His name is Jacob Fox. He's Jacob Fox at Stanford. Also a very big inspiration for me. We were both grad students together at the same time. Well, most importantly, you're good at selecting good friends. Ah, yeah, well, that's the key. You gotta find good people to learn things from. But his thing was, he often said, if you solve a math problem and have this math proof, math problem for him is\n\nit's Eric Fromm in a book called Escape from Freedom. He's like, look, you're smart enough to know that the most direct way that we typically communicate with our fellow human beings is through language. But you also know that language is a pale shadow of the totality of our interior phenomenological existence. Therefore, there's always going to be times in our lives where even under the best of circumstances, you could be trying desperately to convey your thoughts and feelings and somebody listening could be like, yeah, I get it, I get it, I get it. And you're like, you have no fucking idea\n\nBut then one of the things that Jacob did is he treated that sentence, not as a command from a person, but as a representation of the internal kind of a state of the mind of this policy, essentially. So that when it was faced with a new task, what it would do is it would basically try to think of possible language descriptions, attempt to do them and see if they led to the right outcome. So it would kind of think out loud, like, you know, I'm faced with this new task. What am I going to do? Let me go to the red house. Oh, that didn't work. Let me go to the blue room or something.

And so what they thought, and this is what the ancient historians described, is that they effectively tried to draw a right angle triangle with the two entrances at each end of the hypotenuse. And the way they did it is like they would go around the mountain and kind of walking in a grid fashion. And then you can figure out the two sides of the triangle. And then after you have that triangle, you can effectively draw two smaller triangles at each entrance that are proportional to that big triangle.

So it's very random. Yeah. Okay, so what's interesting about this tunnel? So this tunnel was built in the sixth century BC. And it was built in the island of Samos, which is, as I said, off the coast of Turkey. And they had the city on one side, and they had a mountain, and then they had a bunch of springs on the other side, and they wanted to bring water into the city. Building an aqueduct would be pretty hard because of the way the mountain was shaped. And it would also, if they were under a siege, they could just easily destroy that aqueduct, and then the water wouldn't\n\nQuestion: What did the ancient historians describe about the entrances to the mountain?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What was the purpose of flashing the word 'death' for 28 milliseconds in the lab?", "answer": "To measure people's reactions or behavior thereafter.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And I think Uber is an interesting example here where it's like, okay, if we had self driving trucks or self driving cars, we could automate what used to be taxi service. There's a whole bunch of stuff that's already been automated, like the dispatching. So the dispatchers are already out of work in rideshare and the payment is already automated. So you have to automate steps like this. So you have to have that initial link to dispatch the truck. You have to have the automated mapping.

You have to make all of these, the decision gets really complicated. Like when does the war begin, right? Does it begin when a certain number of people have been killed? Did it begin, what if there's like lots of skirmishing and sort of little terror attacks or a couple bombs lobbed and then eventually turns into war?

What do you make of JavaScript in general? So you're talking in the platonic sense about languages, about what they're good at, what their philosophy of design is. But there's also a large user base behind each of these languages and they use it in the way\n\nhow to construct a programming language. So perhaps not one programming language, but a unification of how we build programming languages, if you remember such statements. I have some trouble remembering it, but I know the origin of that idea. So maybe you can talk about sort of C++ has been improving. There's been a lot of programming language. Do you, where does the arc of history taking us? Do you hope that there is a unification about the languages with which we communicate in the digital space? Well, I think that languages should be designed not by clobbering language features together\n\nSo I would say, for me, the main insight I have is, to succeed as a programmer, you eventually kind of stop writing code. That's going to sound discouraging, probably, to people hearing. But I don't mean it that way. What I mean is that you're coding at a higher level language. Eventually, like, OK, so we're coding in assembly language. That's the beginning, right? You're hardcoded to the architecture. Then you have stuff like C, where it's like, wow, we can abstract across the architecture. We can write code. I can then compile that code for ARM or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there.\n\nQuestion: What is the speaker's opinion on how programming languages should be designed?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the tenure and why is it a great privilege?", "answer": "The tenure is a great privilege because it allows you to explore things that are not accepted by others.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

They said, hey, things are going okay, you're doing well, paper's coming out, but you're kind of spending a lot of time doing this open source stuff, maybe do a little less of that, and a little more of the paper writing and grant writing, which was naive, but it was definitely the thinking. It still goes on. Still goes on. You're basically creating a thing which enables science in the 21st century. Right. Maybe don't emphasize that so much in your free year tenure. Right. It illustrates some of the challenges. Yes. It does, and\n\nwho right mindedly felt that I wouldn't get much done there. But what they told me at Skidmore was take your time, show up for your classes and don't molest barnyard animals and you'll probably get tenure. And I'm like, I'll show up for my classes. We'll talk about it. That was the negotiation. Yeah, I negotiated, I drove a hard bargain. But honestly, Lex, that's, I feel I'm very committed to Skidmore because I was given tenure when our first terror management paper wasn't published. It took eight years to publish. It was rejected at every journal.

So you have this network that is highly interconnected. And I think it's safe to say that one of the primary reasons that they make so many different connections is that allows information to be communicated very rapidly from any spot in the network to any other spot in the network. So that's a sort of spatial aspect of it. You can quantify this in terms of concepts that are related to fractals and scale invariants, which I think is a very beautiful concept. So what I mean\n\nconnections? Right, well, that seems to, so again, not a neuroscientist here, but my reading of the literature is that that's particularly crucial in early stages of brain development where a newborn is born with tons of extra synaptic connections and it's actually pruned over time. So the number of synapses decreases as opposed to growing new long distance connections. It is possible in the brain to grow new neurons and assign new synaptic connections but it doesn't seem to be the primary mechanism by which the brain is learning. So for example, like right now, sitting here talking to you,\n\nbreak it down. Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said before, they're sophisticated devices in and of themselves and synapses are too. They can change their state based on the activity. So they adapt over time. That's crucial to the way the brain works. They don't just adapt on one timescale, they can adapt on myriad timescales from the spacing between pulses, the spacing between spikes that come from neurons all the way to the age of the organism. Also relevant, perhaps I think the most important thing that's guided my thinking is the network structure of the brain, so.

So it's hard to combine simple debugging with the optimal code, because the idea is to drag in information from different parts of the code to generate good code, machine code. And that's not readable. So what people often do for debugging is they turn the optimizer off. And so you get code that when something in your source code looks like a function call, it is a function call. When the optimizer is turned on, it may disappear, the function call, it may inline.

Or it's not how it first seemed. Like the Necker cube is a good example of that. Like the Necker cube is just that schematic of a cube, of a transparent cube, which pops out one way or the other. Then one face can pop out and then the other face can pop out. But you can actually just see it as flat with no pop out, which is a more veridical way of looking at it. So there are subject, there are kind of inward correlates to this. And I would say that the sense of self\n\nsomebody who actually is, say, a friend of mine, but until I kind of realized that it is him, he looks different. And then when I finally clock that it's him, his features switch like a Necker cube into the familiar form. As it were, I've taken his face out of the filing cabinet inside and grafted it onto or used the sense data to invoke it. Yeah, we do some kind of miraculous compression on this whole thing to be able to filter out most of the sense data and make sense of it. That's just a magical thing that we do. So you've written several, many amazing books, but let me ask, what books,\n\ninterval. I just described for you a four dimensional space. Do you want a six dimensional space? No problem, take a corner of a room. In fact, if you want to have a sphere times a sphere times a sphere times a sphere, take a cube. A cube is a rendition of this six dimensional space, two sphere times another sphere times another sphere, where three of the circles I'm not drawing for you. For each one of those directions, there's another circle. But each time you get to the boundary of the cube, one circle shrinks. When the boundaries meet, two circles shrinks.

I don't think it's accurate, and therefore I don't think it's useful. So here's what I would say. I think that the way I think about philosophy and science is that they are useful tools for living. And in order to be useful tools for living, they have to help you make good decisions. The triune brain, as it's called, this three layer brain, the idea that your brain is like an already baked cake and the cortex, cerebral cortex, just layered on top like icing. The idea, that idea is the foundation of the law in most Western countries. It's the foundation\n\nis absolutely crucial. So that's what wave guides are. Yeah, that's great. Why the third dimension is crucial? Okay, so yes, you were talking about what are some of the technical limitations. One of the things that I believe we have to grapple with is that our brains are miraculously compact. For the number of neurons that are in our brain, it sure does fit in a small volume, as it would have to if we're gonna be biological organisms that are resource limited and things like that. Any kind of hardware neuron is almost certainly gonna be much bigger than that if it is of comparable complexity,\n\ntalk about what are the different parts of the brain and, in your view, sort of loosely, and how do they contribute to intelligence? Do you see the brain as a bunch of different modules, and they together come in the human brain to create intelligence? Or is it all one mush of the same kind of fundamental architecture? Yeah, that's an important question. And there was a phase in neuroscience back in the 1950 or so in which it was believed for a while that the brain was equipotential. This was the term. You could cut out a piece, and nothing special happened apart a little bit less performance.\n\nQuestion: What is the triune brain and why is it important?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What are some of the different business models that can be used for something that has zero marginal cost?", "answer": "Some of the different business models that can be used for something that has zero marginal cost include ad supported systems, bundling things together, volunteer work, and donations.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

So I used to at MIT, at Stanford, I'm not quite sure. I'm not teaching until next spring. I'm still thinking what my course is gonna be. But there are a lot of different business models. And when you have something that has zero marginal cost, there's a lot of forces, especially if there's any kind of competition that push prices down to zero.

And I think economists\n\nBoth of them have some inefficiencies. And then when you get into targeting and you get into these other revenue models, it gets more complicated, but there's some economic theory on it. I also think to be frank, there's just a lot of experimentation that's needed because sometimes things are a little counterintuitive, especially when you get into what are called two sided networks or platform effects, where you may grow the market on one side and harvest the revenue on the other side. Facebook tries to get more and more users and then they harvest the revenue from advertising. So that's\n\nIf the answer is yes, then economies of scale are not the issue. Do you throw into manufacturing, do you throw like supply chain? Talked about resources and materials and stuff like that. Do you throw that into the calculation of trying to reason from first principles, like how we're gonna make the supply chain work here? Yeah, yeah. And then the cost of materials, things like that.

Some manufacturers, auto manufacturers sort of have something beta version, maybe an alpha version of this already starting to come online, where they have a little camera in the wheel that I think tries to look at some features. Almost everybody doing this and it's very alpha.

The primary signal that they're\n\na bunch of sensors, primarily cameras, but also radar and ultrasonics, GPS, and so forth. And then that, that information is then rendered into vector space and that, you know, with a bunch of objects with, with properties like lane lines and traffic lights and other cars. And then in vector space that is rerendered onto a display. So you can confirm whether the car knows what's going on or not by looking out the window. Right. I think that's an extremely powerful thing for people to get an understanding. So it become one with the system and understanding what the system is capable of. Now,\n\nof the system, at least early on, and they understand together with the instrument cluster display, they start to understand what are the capabilities. So that's a benefit. The con is you go, you're letting drivers use it basically anywhere. So anyway, that could detect lanes with confidence. Was there a philosophy, uh, design decisions that were challenging that were being made there or from the very beginning, was that, uh, done on purpose with intent?

So in general, when we talk about blockchain, we refer to this distributor in a decentralized fashion. So essentially you have a community of nodes that come together. And even though each one may not be trusted, and as long as a certain thresholds of the set of nodes behaves properly, then the system can essentially achieve certain properties. For example, in the distributed ledger setting, you can maintain an immutable log and\n\nbut it's nevertheless as beautiful from a big database person. It's an interesting way to store information that, especially that's totally publicly accessible. It's I know that to Bitcoin proof of work is the fundamental idea, but to cryptocurrency and digital money in general and to money, the blockchain is a really interesting idea to me. The way I think about it is it's kind of, you know, physics. And I like that there's a place that you can rely on that's very difficult to mess with.

I guess we're walking backwards because we'll we'll have the big picture conversation about what is panpsychism, but given your kind of broad theory of consciousness, what's unique about humans, do you think? As a panpsychist, there is a great continuity between humans and the rest of the universe. There's nothing that special about human consciousness. It's just a highly evolved form of what exists throughout the universe. So we're very much\n\nof what exists throughout the universe.

So just like what we talked about for adversarial example, it can easily fill image\n\nobject detection and classification, like you're finding pedestrians and cars and cyclists and, you know, cones and signs and vegetation and being very good at estimating kind of detection, classification, and state estimation. There's just stable stakes, like that's step zero of this whole stack. You can be incredibly good at that, whether you use cameras or light as a radar, but that's just, you know, that's stable stakes, that's just step zero. Beyond that, you get into the really interesting challenges of semantic understanding at the perception level, you get into scene level reasoning,\n\nawesome. Right, so that's on the attack side, showing us the segmentation system, even though they have been effective in practice, but at the same time, they're really, really easily filled. So then the question is, how can we defend against this? How we can build a more resilient segmentation system? So that's what we try to do. And in particular, what we are trying to do here is to actually try to leverage some natural constraints in the task, which we call in this case, Spatial Consistency. So the idea of the Spatial Consistency is the following.

Yes, I was talking about Dirac, right.

So Einstein's, you know, developed general relativity and he's beginning to develop the foundation of quantum mechanics at the same time, the photoelectric effects and others. And so quantum mechanics overtakes, in fact, Einstein in many ways because he doesn't like the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics and the formulas that's emerging, but fits his march on and try to, for example, combine Einstein's theory of relativity with quantum mechanics.

But also culturally perhaps didn't feel like you fit in. Feeling like just a fish out of water. I just, you know, but, and at the same time that sort of drove me in the sense that it drove an opening of my mind because I\n\nthose men and their path, but for myself. And so during that time, I was more dismissive of my dad's epistemology than I would have liked to have been. I got to correct that later and apologize for it. But that's the first thought that came to mind. You've written the following. I've had the experience countless times, making love, watching a sunset, listening to music, feeling the breeze, that I would sign up for this whole life and all of its pains just to experience this exact moment. This is a kind of wordless knowing. It's the most important and real truth I know, that experience itself\n\nQuestion: What drove an opening of the speaker's mind?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the benefit of recuperation during training?", "answer": "Recuperation allows the body to assimilate the information learned during training.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And I think sometimes we underestimate the benefit of recuperation because I think we assimilate the information that we learn during a training when we recuperate and not during the training itself. And this whole mentality of harder, heavier, you know, it's good for someone who's lazy. And if you're an elite athlete, most of the time, you know, like you're not always, but most of the time is because you're not lazy. And a lot of guys, sometimes they're elite athletes, champions, and you'll hear people say, oh, I\n\nam I gonna be able to train again? That's the only place I feel great, right? Or I've got a ton of work to do. I'm not gonna be able to feel good until I get all this work done, right? So I've got some deadline that's coming. You always think that your life has to change, the world has to change so that you can finally have a good enough excuse to truly, to just be here and here is enough, where the present moment becomes totally captivating. Meditation is another name for the discovery that you can actually just train yourself to do that on demand. So just looking at a cup can be good enough\n\nI'm much more clear in my mind. I'm much more creative. I feel better. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big difference. I just wish I would have known that before. Well, it's fascinating, the role of the mind in all of this. How important is it for your mind to be clear, to really think deeply? There's a judoka American named Travis Stevens. I remember he said something that the right kind of practice is when your mind is exhausted at the end of it, that you were constantly thinking through things like your body shouldn't be exhausted first, your mind should be exhausted first.

So, in other words, I could learn not only about the Bible, but about the secondary literature about the Bible, the things that scholars have written about it. And so, that gave me a way to zoom in on parts of the thing, so that I could get more insight. And so, I look at it as a way of giving me some firm pegs, which I could hang pieces of information, but not as things where I would say, and therefore, this is true. In this random approach of sampling the Bible, what did you learn about the most central, one of the biggest accumulation of ideas\n\nmade about how they want their world. What book or books, technical or fiction or philosophical, when you like look back, you know, life had a big impact, maybe it was a turning point, it was inspiring in some way. Maybe we're talking about some silly book that nobody in their right mind would want to read. Or maybe it's a book that you would recommend to others to read. Or maybe those could be two different recommendations of books that could be useful for people on their journey. When I was in, it's kind of a personal story.

It's kind of what I hear from Daniel Griffin, because increasing numbers of kids are being admitted to hospitals now, because they're becoming the major unvaccinated population.

One is that our brand has been somewhat uniquely challenged in the US compared to other places. It's not that there are.

And what is the role of money in the history of human civilization? Money is a medium of exchange. The thing that defines money is that it is a good that you don't buy for its own sake because you wanna consume it itself or because you want to employ it in the production of other goods, which is what capital goods are. So we have consumption goods, we have capital\n\nthink of money as information. People often will think of money as having power in and of itself. It does not. Money is information and it does not have power in and of itself. Like, you know, applying the physics tools of thinking about things in the limit is helpful. If you are stranded on a tropical island and you have a trillion dollars, it's useless because there's no resource allocation. Money is a database for resource allocation, but there's no resource to allocate except yourself. So, money is useless.

And in that same way, it's possible that playing with these ideas of thinking before bed or some hours before bed or some playing with different protocols will have a significant leap over what mother nature naturally does. So if you let your body do what it naturally does, you may not achieve the same level of performance because mother nature has not designed us to think deeply about chip design or programming artificial intelligence systems.

They're called that because the attacks started right on the first day of our annual conference at DEF CON that happens to be in Shanghai that year. So what happened basically was that someone came up with a way to create blocks that were very slow for one client to process, but not the other client.

Like Prism was not producing blocks, but all the other clients were still producing blocks. There's four others, right? Yes, it's a Prism, Nimbus, Teku, and the Lighthouse. And then also Ethereum back in 2016 had this fun events that we call the Shanghai DOS attacks. They're called that\n\nattacks and the literature that's developing the defense, who would you say is winning right now? Right now, of course, it's attack side. It's much easier to develop attacks, and there are so many different ways to develop attacks. Even just us, we developed so many different methods for doing attacks. And also you can do white box attacks, you can do black box attacks, where attacks you don't even need, the attacker doesn't even need to know the architecture of the target system and not knowing the parameters of the target system and all that. So there are so many different types of attacks.\n\nQuestion: What is the Shanghai DOS attacks and when did they occur?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the Protoss race in StarCraft known for?", "answer": "The Protoss race is known for being the most technologically advanced race with expensive but powerful units and fancy spells.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nthe dynamics of the game seen from a strategic perspective. So Protoss, so in StarCraft there are three races. Indeed, in the demonstration, we saw only the Protoss race. So maybe let's start with that one. Protoss is kind of the most technologically advanced race. It has units that are expensive but powerful. So in general, you want to kind of conserve your units as you go attack. And then you want to utilize these tactical advantages of very fancy spells and so on and so forth. And at the same time, they're kind of, people say they're a bit easier to play perhaps. But that I actually didn't\n\nknow because it depends on the regions. I think it's pretty equal in terms of distribution. And Blizzard wants it to be equal. They wouldn't want one race like Protoss to not be representative in the top place. So definitely, they tried it to be balanced. So then maybe the opposite race of Protoss is Zerg. Zerg is a race where you just kind of expand and take over as many resources as you can, and they have a very high capacity to regenerate their units. So if you have an army, it's not that valuable in terms of losing the whole army is not a big deal as Zerg because you can then rebuild it.\n\nin this sense of, OK, what could be maybe the next iteration of putting more rules that makes the agents more humanlike in terms of restrictions? Yeah, putting constraints that. More constraints, yeah. That's really interesting. That's really innovative. So one of the constraints you put on yourself, or at least focused in, is on the Protoss race, as far as I understand. Can you tell me about the different races and how they, so Protoss, Terran, and Zerg, how do they compare? How do they interact? Why did you choose Protoss? Yeah, in the dynamics of the game seen from a strategic perspective.\n\nQuestion: What is the Protoss race in StarCraft known for?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the advantage of having control of the hardware part of the stack?", "answer": "It is advantageous for processing massive amounts of data.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Because I know if I do a nice, easy turn, the airplane will make it at what doesn't bleed energy. But I know if I do a real tight, that 2,500 foot split S, that it's going to cost me energy. So if I enter the split S at 200 knots and I do it right, I'm going to come out at the bottom at probably 200 knots. Although I lost 2,500 feet of potential energy, I converted that to that, to kinetic and that kinetic\n\nand I do this, I'm going to end up over here and he's going to be above me.

In fact, the tendency for humans in the face of threats from infectious disease is to exaggerate the fear in their own minds of being contaminated by the environment and by others. That's just natural to humans. And the role of public health is not necessarily to eradicate the fear, but obviously technological advances can help eradicate the fear, but it's really to help manage that fear and help people put the sort of incentives that come out of that to useful\n\nQuestion: What is the consequence of intentionally stoking fear in order to gain compliance with public health edicts?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the speaker's opinion of George's ability to implement the paper?", "answer": "The speaker thinks that George will not struggle with implementing the paper.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

But we've done some good at learning that. But the second one, not to do communism again, not to do socialism, I think we're way away from knowing because we don't know how it happened. And the little temptations are still there always. Look at people\n\nmurderous. Well, the question is what is the source of the most viral and sticky stories that ultimately lead to a positive outcome? So communism was, I mean, having grown up in the Soviet Union, even still having relatives in Russia, there's a stickiness to the nationalism and to the ideologies of communism that religious or not, you could say it's religious forever. I could just say it's stories that are viral and sticky. I'm using the most horrible words, but the question is whether science and reason can generate viral sticky stories that give meaning to people's lives.

Yeah, exactly. And as we're getting into harder and harder questions, let's go to the hard problem of consciousness. Is this an important problem for us to think about and solve on the engineering of intelligence side of your work, of our dream? It's unclear. So again, this is a deep problem, partly because it's very difficult to define consciousness. And there is a debate among neuroscientists about whether consciousness and philosophers, of course, whether consciousness is something that requires\n\nof mind, philosophy of language, and consciousness. He's perhaps best known for formulating the hard problem of consciousness, which could be stated as why does the feeling which accompanies awareness of sensory information exist at all? Consciousness is almost entirely a mystery. Many people who worry about AI safety and ethics believe that, in some form, consciousness can and should be engineered into AI systems of the future.

And once that vertebrate brain plan evolved, it spread everywhere. So fish have it and dogs have it and we have it. We have adaptations of it and specializations of it, but, and the same thing with a primate brain plan. So monkeys have it and apes have it and we have it. So there are additional innovations like color vision and those spread really rapidly. So it takes evolution a long time to get a good idea, but, and I'm being anthropomorphic and not literal here, but once it has that idea, so to speak, which cashes out\n\nwhen a backbone evolved and a brain evolved, a full brain, that was when a head evolved with sense organs and when that's when your viscera, like internal systems involved. So the answer I would say is that senses, motor neuroscientists, people who study the control of motor behavior believe that senses evolved in the service of motor action. So the idea is that, like what triggered, what was the big evolutionary change? What was the big pressure that made it useful to have eyes and ears and a visual system and an auditory system and a brain basically? And the answer that is commonly\n\nthere's no brain, but that animal also had no head, and it had no eyes, and it had no ears, and it had really, really no senses for the most part.

It had a vestibular cell so that it could keep upright in the water.

So under the Soviet Union, there was something called the Gosbank or People's Bank. And that was the only bank in the country. And you had an account with the National Bank. And if you said\n\nyou had an account with the National Bank. And if you said something wrong, your money got terminated from the Gosbank. Now, imagine that combined with the power of digital technology. And you can see that this could be an enormously powerful technology really, because if banks are out of the picture, then we changed the fundamental reality of fiat as being the creation of money through lending. And then it becomes the creation of money truly by fiat, by government fiat. So we moved to a system in which money is just basically, it's like we have money that is pieces of paper. And every time\n\nessentially government credit. And so it's just sending a message from one central bank to another and you can move it halfway around the world. Is there also something to be said about the cost in time? So you're saving the sort of, you're reducing the friction of the communication as well. Exactly. Of the transactions as well. Exactly, it's faster. How big is that benefit? Because wouldn't you argue that that potential is the thing that enables modern economy, both the speed and the low cost, so increasing the scale and the frequency, the speed of the transactions?

And that's not readable. So what people often do for debugging is they turn the optimizer off.

What do you find interesting about this guy and his ideas about artificial intelligence in general? So I have a kind of personal story to share. So I started my PhD in Canada back in 2000. And so essentially my PhD was, so we were developing sort of a new language for symbolic machine learning. So it's different from the feature based machine learning. And one of the sort of cleanest applications of this approach, of this formalism was to cheminformatics and computer aided drug design. So essentially we were, as a part of my research, I developed a system that essentially looked at\n\nthen that leads you into cognitive science and you can look at, say, what are the different types of memory that the human mind and brain has? And this has matured over the last decades and I got into this a lot. So after getting my PhD in math, I was an academic for eight years. I was in departments of mathematics, computer science, and psychology. When I was in the psychology department at the University of Western Australia, I was focused on cognitive science of memory and perception.

Thompson. He said, what matters most is how you walk through the fire, I think. So there's a bit of the Ken Haines in that too, David Goggins in that too. What do you think he meant by that? Well, how you walk through the fire. I mean, you can walk through the fire complaining along the way, or you can walk through the fire and\n\nto everything, a fresh way to approach a dull or dangerous thing. To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it. To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art. What do you think he meant by that? Do you agree with this? A dangerous thing with style is art. He said bullfighting can be art, boxing can be art, loving can be art. Have you ever made love and it was art? No, okay, I'm not asking. Every time, bro. Opening a can of sardines can be art. I think there's something to that. Yeah, I think, I call the way people live life art.

And I think the only reason why, so it certainly has not been going up. That metric has been stagnating for a long time now while all of this was going on. I think the only reason why it hasn't fallen is that we added these extra shifts off the books. I'm gonna work for three hours in the morning, I'm gonna work for three hours at night. And only that I think has allowed us to basically maintain a stagnated non industrial growth. We should have been shooting up the charts.

You studied the development of the human brain for many years. So let me ask you an out of the box question first. How likely is it that there's intelligent life out there in the universe outside of earth with something like the human brain? So I can put it another way. How unlikely is the human brain? How difficult is it to build a thing through the evolutionary process? Well, it has happened here, right? On this planet. Once, yes. Once.

A start and a stop. And right now it's just a bunch of amino acids, but if we could fold it, maybe the fold would be like something we already know, some protein fold, which gives you a lot of clues, right? Because there are only so many protein folds in biology and that dark matter is probably one of them. So I think that's very exciting because for years, I've followed structural biologists for years and in the beginning, we couldn't even solve structures of viruses, they're too big.

Pauli had said, you know, there's this principle called the exclusion principle that, you know, two electrons cannot be on the same orbit. And so Dirac said, okay, you know what? All these negative energy states are filled orbits, occupied. So according to you, Mr. Pauli, there's no place to go. So therefore they only have to go positive. Sounded like a big cheat. And then Pauli said, oh, you know what? We can change orbits from one orbit to another. What if I take one of these negative energy orbits and put it up there? Then it seems to be a new particle, which has\n\na pretty dark phase before writing that paper. He lost enthusiasm with physics and doing physics problems. And there was one time when he was in the cafeteria of Cornell, and he saw a guy that was throwing plates in the air. And he noticed that when the plate was in the air, there were two movements there. The plate was wobbling, but he also noticed that the Cornell symbol was rotating. And he was able to figure out the equations of motions of those plates. And that led him to kind of think a little bit about electron orbits in relativity, which led to the paper about quantum electrodynamics.\n\nQuestion: What did Pauli tell Dirac before he realized his mistake?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What does the speaker say about copying skills?", "answer": "The speaker says that they are limited in how much they can copy and that they would love to copy the other person's Russian speaking skills, but they can't.

The experiment was not enough. They didn't think that they have to soil their hands in doing experiments to get to the reality. They said, why is it the case? Why? So Galileo had to come up with an explanation of why heavier and lighter objects fall at the same rate. This is the way he convinced them using symmetry.

And that I'd like to think that we've taken it far enough so that we've written at least one really good paper in a top journal, hopefully a number that we've reduced it to practice and animal models that we've filed patents, maybe had issued patents that have what I'll call\n\nwe could understand perhaps what is going wrong. Perhaps we could use as a platform, as a cellular platform to screen for drugs, to fix a process and so on and so forth, right? So we could do it now, we couldn't do it five years ago. Should we not do it? What is the downside of doing it? I don't see a downside at this very moment. If we invited a lot of people, I'm sure there would be somebody who would argue against it. What would be the devil's advocate argument? Yeah, yeah. So it's exactly perhaps what you alluded at with your question, that you are enabling some process of formation of the\n\nsimple building blocks connected in potentially simple or sometimes complicated ways, and then emergent new behavior that was hard to predict from those simple elements. And that's exactly what we're working with here. So it's a very exciting platform, both from a modeling perspective and from a hardware manifestation perspective where we can hopefully start to have this test bed where we can explore things, not just related to neuroscience, but also related to other things that connected to other physics like critical phenomenon, Ising models, things like that.

The problem I always have with our system here in the United States right now is trying to tease the truth out from all the falsehoods. And look, I've got 30 years in journalism. My job used to be to go through, before the internet, all the newspapers, and find the, I used to know all the journalists by name, and I could pick out, you know, who they were, and I have a hard time picking out the truth from the falsehoods, so I think\n\ntraditional American perspective, because we've had yellow, so called yellow journalism since the founding of the Republic.

So like I view COVID as, among other things, a truly terrifyingly failed dress rehearsal for something far worse, right? I mean, COVID is just about as benign as it could have been and still have been worse than the flu when you're talking about a global pandemic, right? So it's\n\nthe threats facing human civilization, nuclear war, natural or engineer pandemics, you know, we talk about human rights violations. We talk about authoritarian governments taking control of the money supply, but do you have grander concerns for the future of human civilization? Do you have hope for us becoming a multi planetary species? Yeah, I mean, I, I guess longterm we'd want to decentralize, right? We don't want a single point of failure in the earth is a single point of failure. But no, I mean, you look at all this kind of like space fiction and I mean, who would want to live on Mars,\n\nto deal with overwhelming threats right in front of us. So I have quite a bit of faith in humanity when it comes to impending doom right outside our door. If Krypton's about to explode, I think humanity can rouse themselves to great, and would give power to the people who needed it and be willing to make the sacrifices. But that's what makes, I think, the pollution slash climate change slash screwing up your environment threat so particularly insidious is it happens slowly, right? It defies fight and flight mechanisms. It defies the natural ability we have to deal with the threat that's right\n\nQuestion: What does the speaker consider to be the biggest threat to the survival of the human species?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the author's view on luck and success?", "answer": "The author believes that luck plays a significant role in a person's success and that people are just reaping the fruits of one lottery after another.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And therefore everyone, what we're seeing really are differences in luck in the world. We're seeing people who are very, very lucky to have had good parents and good genes and to be in good societies and had good opportunities and to be intelligent and to be, you know, not as intelligent as they were in the past.

You can pick whichever one you want, poker or life and or life. The longer you play, the less influence luck has. Like with all things, the bigger your sample size, the more the quality of your decisions\n\neverything else too. The game theory of it. Yes, yeah, essentially. And what's interesting is that nowadays, if you want to be a top pro and you go and play in these really like the super high stakes tournaments or tough cash games, if you don't know this stuff, you're gonna get eaten alive in the long run. But of course you could get lucky over the short run and that's where this like luck factor comes in because luck is both a blessing and a curse. If luck didn't, if there wasn't this random element and there wasn't the ability for worse players to win sometimes, then poker would fall apart.\n\nQuestion: What is the author's view on luck and success?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the author's opinion on erasing history and tradition?", "answer": "The author believes that erasing history and tradition can lead to the emergence of bad ideas, especially when some ideas are deliberately left uninterrogated.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

We borrow examples from lower dimensions, build up intuition and draw the same pictures as if we are talking about 10 dimensions, but we are drawing the same as a two dimensional plane because we cannot do any better. But our words change, but not our pictures. So your sense is we can have a deep understanding of reality by looking at its slices, at lower dimensional slices. Exactly, exactly. And this brings me to\n\nby analogies, we build intuition. So I will start with this example. I will try to explain that if we are in 10 dimensional space, if we have a seven dimensional plane and eight dimensional plane, we ask typically in what space do they intersect each other in what dimension? That might sound like, how do you possibly give an answer to this? So we start with lower dimensions. We start with two dimensions. We say, if you have one dimension and a point, do they intersect typically on a plane? The answer is no.

The path tells you how did you get from one thing to the other thing. It's the story of how you got from this to that. The theorem is the thing at one end is equal to the thing at the other end. The proof is the path you go down to get from one thing to the other. You mentioned that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem fits naturally there. How does it fit? Yeah, so what happens there is that the G\u00f6del's theorem is basically saying that there are paths of infinite length. That is that there's no upper bound. If you know these two things, you say, I'm\n\nwhat's true, and this is this whole story about the path you have to follow and how long is the path, and G\u00f6del's theorem is the statement that the path is not a bounded length, but the fact that the path is not always compressible to something tiny is a story of computational irreducibility. So that's why math is hard. Now, the next question is, why is math doable? Because it might be the case that most things you care about don't have finite length paths. Most things you care about might be things where you get lost in the sea of computational irreducibility and worse, undecidability. That\n\nrule from which all of mathematics arises. The way it works though is a little different from the way things work in sort of a computation because in mathematics, what you're interested in is a proof and the proof says, from here, you can use, from this expression, for example, you can use these axioms to get to this other expression. So that proves these two things are equal. Okay, so we can begin to see how this has been going to work. What's gonna happen is there are paths in metamathematical space. So what happens is each, two different ways to look at it. You can just look at it as\n\nQuestion: What is G\u00f6del's theorem and what does it say about the path?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "Why is it important for people to have websites like archive?", "answer": "It is important for people to have websites like archive so that they can share content before it gets published on the website of the journal and is locked for three years.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

So this is literally the longest upload period on the internet. And during those three years, their content is just locked. And so that's why it's so important for people to have websites that are open to people to have websites like archive so that you can share that before it goes to the journal with the rest of the world. There was actually on archive that Perelman published the three papers that led to the proof of the Poincare conjecture. And then you have other fields like machine learning, for instance, where the field is evolving at such a\n\nabout it. For some tools in science, it just takes time for them to grow.

And for people that don't know, archive is these kind of online repositories where people put preprints, which are versions of the papers, before they actually make it to journals. A R X I V, for people who don't know. And it's actually a really vibrant place to publish your papers in the aforementioned communities of mathematics, physics, and computer science. It started with mathematics and physics, and then over the last 30 years, it evolved. And now, actually computer science\n\nfor instance, where the field is evolving at such a high rate that people don't even wait before the papers go to journals before they start working on top of those papers. So they publish them on archive, then other people see them, they start working on that. And archive did a really good job at building that core platform to host papers. But I think there's a really, really big opportunity in building more features on top of that platform, apart from just hosting papers. So collaboration, annotations, and having other things apart from papers like code and other things.

How do you decide who's person number one and person number two? Yes. So if, for example, you just went out into the downtown and said, hey, get these thousand people, go. Well, if you're gonna go and say, and by the way, you're one and you're two and you're three, that's linear time. Yes. That's cheating. So now the question is how to do this in a distributed way. And there were some people who proposed a very elegant algorithm and they wanted to analyze it. So I came in onto the analyze side, but the elegant algorithm was like this. It\n\ngoing to sit here and wait for someone to come? Okay. Okay. Well, they flipped their coin. Some of the people start asking other people saying, hey, I would like you to be my representative. Here is my number. But the problem is that there's limited bandwidth of the people who are getting asked. It's like, you can't get, you can't go out to prom with five people. But this is not what we're doing. We're adding numbers, okay? But you can only add one number.

And it feels like a beautiful fact. Well, let me explain it this way. Imagine that for every match, you didn't give one point, but you gave two points. You gave one point to each person. Now that's not what we're really doing. We really want to give one point to the winner of the match, but instead we'll just give two. If you gave two points to everyone on every matchup, actually everyone has the same number of points. And the number of points they get is how many other people there are.

Okay, we have no clue about this.

Basically every order of magnitude is about equally likely. When then do the math and ask the question, how close is our nearest neighbor? It's again, equally likely that it's 10 to the 10 meters away, 10 to 20 meters away, 10 to the 30 meters away.

Yeah, sleep is profoundly and very intimately related to your memory systems and your informational systems. The first is you just mentioned is that sleep before learning will essentially prepare your brain almost like a dry sponge ready to sort of, you know, initially soak up new information. In other words, you need sleep before learning to effectively imprint information into the brain to lay down fresh memory traces. And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain, and we know we've studied these memory circuits, will,\n\nlearning will cement and solidify that new memory into the neural architecture of the brain, therefore making it less likely to be forgotten. So, you know, I often think of sleep in that way as, it's almost sort of future proofing information. In what way? Well, it means that it gives it a higher degree of assurance to be remembered in the future rather than go through the sort of degradation that we think of as forgetting. So the brain has in some ways by default, you know, there is forget, and actually I would love to, I was going to say sleep is relevant for memory in three different ways,\n\nto say sleep is relevant for memory in three different ways, but I'm going to amend that and say there's four different ways, which is learning, maintaining, memorizing, abstraction, assimilation, association, then forgetting, which the last one sounds oxymoronic based on the former three, but I'll see if I can explain. So sleep after learning then sort of, you know, sets that information like amber in solidification.

And then you plug in numbers into that and you, you know, depending on like the range of, you know, your lower bound and your upper bound point estimates that you put in, you get out a number at the end for the number of\n\nscientific rigor around those hypotheses is ultimately get evidence. Knowledge of what nature is should be a dialogue with nature. Yes. Rather than a monologue. Monologue, beautifully put. Can we talk a little bit about the Drake equation? Another framework from which to have this kind of discussion about possible civilizations out there. So let me ask, within the context of the Drake equation or maybe bigger, how many alien civilizations do you think are out there? Well, it's hard to tell because the Drake equation is again quantifying our ignorance. It's just a set of factors. The only one\n\nour ignorance. It's just a set of factors. The only one that we know, or actually two that we know quite well is the rate of star formation in the Milky Way galaxy, which we measured by now, and the frequency of planets like the Earth around stars and at the right distance to have life. But other than that, there are lots of implicit assumptions about all the other factors that will enable us to detect the signal. Now, I should say the Drake equation has a very limited validity just for signals from civilizations that are transmitting at the time that you're observing them. However, we can do\n\nQuestion: What is the Drake equation used for?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the notion of expected value?", "answer": "The notion of expected value is that if I have a random variable, which has an expected value, there's going to be some possibility in the probability space where you're at least as big as the expected value.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

So what ends up happening is that there's always going to be, like the average number of points per person is going to be half of how many other people there are. And somebody is gonna be above average. Somebody is going to be above that. At least average.

Three values, joy, growth, and choice. I think you need joy. I mean, that's the basis of everything. If you want the number one value. On the other hand, I'm unsatisfied with a static joy that doesn't progress perhaps because of some elemental element of human perversity, but the idea of something that grows and becomes more and more and better and better in some sense appeals to me. But I also sort of like the idea of individuality that as a distinct system, I have some agency.

How many light sources are needed? Oh, you need a light source at every single point. A light source per neuron. Per neuron, per little, but then\n\ndoes nature hint that we can use light and photons for communication? Well, so let me just try and be clear. You can use light for communication in digital systems, just the light sources are not intimately integrated with the silicon. You manufacture all the silicon, you have your microchip, plunk it down. And then you manufacture your light sources, separate chip, completely different process made in a different foundry. And then you put those together at the package level. So now you have some, I would say a great deal of architectural limitations that are introduced by that sort of package\n\nplaces. The brain does it in a slightly different way which we can discuss. How can light achieve the 10,000 connections and why is it better? In terms of like the energy use required to use light for the communication of the 10,000 connections. Right, right. So now instead of trying to send electrons from me to you, I'm trying to send photons. So I can make what's called a wave guide which is just a simple piece of a material. It could be glass like an optical fiber or silicon on a chip.

So I very much do disagree with someone like Sam Harris who thinks there's this overwhelming case. I just think it's non existent.

We know from theory of machine learning, the only way to cut down the sample complexity is to kind of cut down, somehow cut down the hypothesis space. You can do that by building in bias. There's all kinds of reasons to think that nature built bias into humans. Um, convolution is a bias, right? It's a very strong bias and it's a very critical bias. So my own view is that we should look for more things that are like convolution, but the address other aspects of reasoning, right? So convolution helps us a lot with a certain kind of spatial reasoning. That's quite close to the imaging.\n\nget produced as an artifact, presumably, of just how you built it and you didn't even know you engineered it that way, right? You caused it to...

They never even had to have the kind of big lockdowns we had in the West. But the deeper answer to, it's not just the Koreans are just somehow better people. The reason I think they were better prepared was because they had already had a pretty bad hit from the SARS pandemic, or which never became a pandemic, something like 17 years ago, I think. So it was kind of fresh memory that we need to be\n\nwhen I fail. And I think we should all ask ourselves, what can we learn from the pandemic about how we can do better in the future? And you mentioned there a really good lesson. We were not as resilient as we thought we were and we were not as prepared maybe as we wish we were. You can even see very stark contrast around the planet. South Korea, they have over 50 million people. Do you know how many deaths they have from COVID last time I checked? No. It's about 500. Why is that? Well, the short answer is that they had prepared. They were incredibly quick, incredibly quick to get on it with\n\nbe more. I just, I wish we would be more prepared because we know what to do. We know we should be making antivirals vaccines, masks, testing masks, making test modalities that we can really quickly redesign. But after SARS one, all that went out the door. People didn't do anything, and that's why we're in this situation. So people ask me this all the time, are we gonna be ready for the next one? And I always say, we should be. We have all the information we need to know what to do. But somehow I think people forget. That said, sometimes we really step up when the tragedies run in front of us.\n\nQuestion: Why were South Koreans better prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What was the first innovation required to collect data in a far field setup?", "answer": "To collect data in a far field setup, the first innovation required was to create a customer base.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And it's just this place where, you know, bunch of huge truck\n\nto your truck, hey, you know, tell the driver 20 miles ahead, he's got to hop in the seat. That would mean that they're on duty according to the way that the current rules are written, they have some responsibility. And part of that is, you know, we need them to get rest, right? They need to have uninterrupted sleep. So that's what I call autopilot. The final scenario is one that I thought was actually the one scenario that was good for labor, you know, which I proposed is I was like, well, here's an idea, you know, that would be like, actually good for workers. And just another brief aside\n\ntrucks and their potential impacts on labor and on society. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, here's my conversation with Steve Vasile. You wrote a book about trucking called The Big Rig, Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream, and you're currently working on a book about autonomous trucking called Driverless, Autonomous Trucks and the Future of the American Trucker. I have to bring up some Johnny Cash to you because I was just listening to this song. He has a ton of songs about trucking, but one of them I was\n\nQuestion: What does the speaker recommend to journalists who want to write about trucking?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What are the two hard things that need to be done to make a humanoid robot intelligent enough to interact with the environment?", "answer": "The two hard things are making the robot intelligent enough to interact in a sensible way with the environment and having real world AI.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

A lot of hardcore software work is required for that. So since we're kind of like solving the navigate the real world with neural nets problem for cars, which are kind of robots with four wheels, then it's like kind of a natural extension of that is to put it in a robot with arms and legs and actuators. So like the two hard things are like you basically need to make the have the robot be intelligent enough to interact in a sensible way with the environment. So you need real world AI and you need to be very good at\n\na try. But now the robots are starting to understand their environment. And if you think about the next step, there's two dimensions. I've been working so hard since the beginning of iRobot to make robots are autonomous, that, you know, they're smart enough and understand their task enough, they can just go do it without human involvement. Now what I'm really excited and working on is how do I make them less autonomous? Meaning that the robot is supposed to be your partner, not this automaton that just goes and does what a robot does. And so that if you tell it, hey, I just dropped some flour\n\nperform whatever task a human user sets for it, within the physical constraints, of course. If you tell it to teleport to another planet, it probably can't do that. But if you ask it to do something that's within its physical capability, then potentially with a little bit of additional training or a little bit of additional trial and error, it ought to be able to figure it out in much the same way as like a human teleoperator ought to figure out how to drive the robot to do that. That's kind of the very pragmatic view of what it would take to kind of solve the robotics problem, if you will.\n\nQuestion: What are the two hard things that need to be done to make a humanoid robot intelligent enough to interact with the environment?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the purpose of using analogies in understanding the 10 dimensional world?", "answer": "The purpose of using analogies is to build intuition and understand the 10 dimensional world better.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

It was actually in the welcome features. New feature, nevertheless. How do you intuit the 10 dimensional world? So yes, it's a feature for describing certain phenomena like the entropy in black holes, but what you said that to you a theory becomes real or becomes powerful when you can connect it to some deep intuition. So how do we intuit 10 dimensions? Yes, so I will explain how some of the analogies work. First of all, we do a lot of analogies. And by analogies, we build intuition. So I will start with this\n\nby analogies, we build intuition. So I will start with this example. I will try to explain that if we are in 10 dimensional space, if we have a seven dimensional plane and eight dimensional plane, we ask typically in what space do they intersect each other in what dimension? That might sound like, how do you possibly give an answer to this? So we start with lower dimensions. We start with two dimensions. We say, if you have one dimension and a point, do they intersect typically on a plane? The answer is no. So a line one dimensional, a point zero dimension on a two dimensional plane, they\n\na common misinterpretation that if you're asking questions about like a five dimensional manifold, that the only way that that's connected to the physical world is if the physical world is itself a five dimensional manifold or includes them. Well, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. You're telling me you can imagine a five dimensional manifold? No, no, that's not what I said. I would make the claim that it is useful to a three dimensional physical universe, despite itself not being three dimensional. So it's useful meaning to even understand a three dimensional world, it'd be useful to\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of using analogies in understanding the 10 dimensional world?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What are some factors that need to be considered when making choices about information gathering?", "answer": "When making choices about information gathering, factors such as the value of the information, the trade-off between seeing in front and behind, and one's own uncertainty need to be taken into account.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

It just seems scary, the step of collecting the data, and it seems unclear to me how we can do it effectively. Well, you know, seven billion people in the world, each of them had to do that at some point in their lives. And we should leverage that experience that they've all done. We should be able to try to collect that kind of data. Okay, big questions. Maybe stepping back through your life, what book or books, technical or fiction or philosophical, had a big impact on the way you saw the world, on the way you thought about\n\nthat overall action is probably relatively optimal in respect to whatever it is that the person wants. And then that gives you information about what it is that they want. So you can learn that people want you to stay further away from them. Now you're right that there might be many things that explain just that one signal and that you might need much more data than that for the person to be able to shape your reward function over time. You can also do this info gathering stuff that we were talking about. Not that we've done that in that context, just to clarify, but it's definitely something\n\nto see what's going on behind you in the lane. And you have to decide whether you should do that now. And you have to trade off the fact that you're not seeing in front of you and you're looking behind you and how valuable is that information and so on. And so to make choices about information gathering, you have to reasonably space. Also, I mean, also to just take into account your own uncertainty before trying to do things. So you might say, if I understand where I'm standing relative to the door jam, pretty accurately, then it's okay for me to go through the door.

And it might not be nuclear weapons, it might be some other destruction. Bio weapons. But it simply will happen is my view. And I've argued at best we have 700 or 800 years and that's being generous.

It's rather bloody amazing. And it seems like part of the toolbox is this controlled hallucination, which is dreams. Well, it's a relaxing of the rigid constraints. I often think of dreaming as, it's from an information processing standpoint, the prison guards are away and the prisoners are running a mock in a delightful way. And part of the reason is because when you go into dream sleep, the rational part of your brain called the prefrontal cortex, which is the part, it's like the CEO of the brain. It's very good\n\narchitecture of the brain during dream sleep, as if it's chemically brute forced into this relaxed associative memory processing state.

I would say, well, they're probably not rational. They're probably not having logical thought\n\nof all, it's fascinating. It makes a lot of sense, but then immediately takes my mind to, from an engineering perspective, how that could be useful in, for example, AI systems of, if you think about dreaming as an important part about learning and cognition and filtering previous memories of what's important, integrating them. You know, maybe you can correct me, but I see dreaming as a kind of simulation of worlds that are not constrained by physics.

So that's sharding. That's sharding. But the, as I understand, maybe correct me on this, is in the space of Ethereum, the sharding happens on some fixed number. Like the split is on some fixed number. I think it's 64 is the currently sort of proposed number. So how does that help scaling? Is it just the fixed constant scaling\n\nEthereum. Let's not call it Ethereum 2.0, but the future of Ethereum that also may require a hard fork, I don't know, you can correct me on this, is well, broadly ideas for scaling. Yes. And more specifically sort of layer two or layer one and two intersection ideas of how to achieve scaling. And at the core of that is the idea of sharding. So first, what is sharding? Okay, so there's two major paradigms for scaling blockchains, right? As you said, layer one and layer two. And layer one basically means make the blockchain itself capable of processing more transactions by having some mechanism\n\nyou just make it harder and harder to participate as a node and you end up with a system where there's like 20 computers running the whole thing. And it's just very centralized. So sharding basically says, well, instead of just increasing the parameters, what we're going to do is we're going to change the blockchain architecture in such a way that each individual node in the blockchain only needs to store a small portion of the data and only needs to process a small portion of the transactions. So you can think about it as being like inspired by BitTorrent, right?

Could be a big improvement. So that's a, okay, cool. Is there something you can say with words about what kind of circuit, what that looks like? I can give an idea of one of the tools inside, but the actual execution ends up being more complicated. But one of the widgets inside this is building a system where you have like a candidate who plays, like one\n\ngirls, the number of numbers that you need to write down to specify the problem instance is N squared. And the question is how many steps are needed to solve it? And Jack Edmonds and I were the first to show that it could be done in time and cubed. Earlier algorithms required N to the fourth. So as a polynomial function of the size of the input, this is a fast algorithm. Now to illustrate the class NP, the question is how long would it take to verify that a solution is optimal?

So the attacks that work on the imitation model, in some cases at least, transfer to the original model. That's incredible and terrifying. Okay, that's amazing work.

So like the first time I worked in a conflicted place was in Northern Uganda in maybe the last couple of years of a long running war. So this would have been 2004, 2005. This is a small East African country. And the north of the country had been engulfed in, think of it as like a 20 year low level insurgency run by a self proclaimed messiah who wasn't that popular and no one joined his movement so he would kidnap kids. And so the, I never, I could talk to people who'd come back from being there. I\n\nmissed our opportunity as a player on the global stage with military capability to prevent the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Syria. We had the ability and we didn't leverage that ability. You know, the fact that I talked with so many Syrians during the course of doing that project who told me their stories of living in their house, right? And having a Syrian helicopter fly over their house and drop a 55 gallon drum full of explosives and shrapnel in their neighborhood over and over and over again. Not focused on any military targets, only meant to kill and sow fear, right?\n\nQuestion: Why did the author not talk to any active members of the armed group they were writing about?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the author questioning about the brain and computer science networks?", "answer": "The author is questioning whether the brain is as deep as the deepest computer science networks and whether the depth of computer science networks is necessitated by the fact that the only learning that's easily done on a machine is feed forward.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nOr is it something fundamentally different going on in the brain? I don't think the brain is as deep as the deepest networks go, the deepest computer science networks. And I do wonder whether part of that depth of the computer science networks is necessitated by the fact that the only learning that's easily done on a machine is feed forward. And so there's the question of to what extent is the biology, which has some feed forward and some feed back, been captured by something which has got many more neurons but much more depth than the neurons in it. So part of you wonders if the feedback is\n\nmaybe? That's one way. No, I like that. Because again, one caricature of the history of computer science, you could say, begins with programmers, expensive. Continuous labelers, cheap. And the future will be schools, like we have for kids. Yeah. Currently, the labeling methods were not selective about which examples we teach networks with. So I think the focus of making networks that learn much faster is often on the architecture side. But how can we pick better examples with which to learn? Do you have intuitions about that? Well, that's part of the problem. But the other one is, if we look\n\nquestion, I would say you have to understand it at different levels. If you really want to build one, right? But for the brain, I think these levels of understanding, so the algorithms, which kind of computation, the equivalent of PowerPoint, and the circuits, the transistors, I think they are much more intertwined with each other. There is not a neatly level of the software separate from the hardware. And so that's why I think in the case of the brain, the problem is more difficult and more than for computers requires the interaction, the collaboration between different types of expertise.\n\nQuestion: What is the author questioning about the brain and computer science networks?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What was the challenge with leveraging RPM as a package manager?", "answer": "RPM is an operating system specific package manager and they wanted a package manager that works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux the same.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

It doesn't tell us about what the particle is in itself. That was Kant's thing in itself. So here's a view. The nature in itself of a particle is something mental. A particle is actually a conscious, a little conscious subject with properties of its consciousness that correspond to its physical properties. The laws of physics are actually ultimately relating these properties of conscious subjects. So in this view, a Newtonian world actually would be a vast collection of little conscious subjects at the bottom level, way,\n\nthinking we understand any of it, like how the mind works at all.

And by the way, we're\n\non fighters and bomber technology in World War II, but that ended up being more wide ranging than that, because I just went down the total rathole of studying all of the fighters and bombers of World War II and the constant rock, paper, scissors game that one country would make this plane, then it would make a plane to beat that, and that country would make a plane to beat that. And really what matters is the pace of innovation and also access to high quality fuel and raw materials.

So I think that's a distinction. It might be difficult to totally pin it down how we define those things, but I think there's a fairly clear and very important difference there. So you think there's a kind of direct observation that you're able to do of your pain that I'm not. So my observation, all the ways in which I can sneak up to observing your pain is indirect versus yours is direct. Can you play devil's advocate? Is it possible for me to get closer and closer and closer to being able to observe your pain,\n\nand closer and closer to being able to observe your pain, like all the subjective experiences, yours in the way that you do? Yeah. I mean, so of course, it's not that we observe behavior and then we make an inference. We are hardwired to instinctively interpret smiles as happiness, crying as sadness. And as we get to know someone, we find it very easy to adopt their perspective, get into their shoes. But strictly speaking, all we have perceptual access to is someone's behavior. And if you were just, strictly speaking, if you were trying to explain someone's behavior, those aspects that are\n\nenough to do mathematics, they could understand our physics. They could look at the data of our experiments. They could run the experiments themselves. Whereas consciousness, is it observable? Is it not observable? In a sense, it's observable. As you say, we could say it's privately observable. I am directly aware of my own feelings and experiences. If I'm in pain, it's just right there for me. My pain is just totally directly evident to me. But you from the outside cannot directly access my pain.

Just to say some obvious things upfront, I don't think pressure from advertisers or politicians directly in any way affects how we think about this.

So correct me if I'm wrong, but in your book, Selfish Gene, the gene centered view of evolution allows us to think of the physical organisms as just the medium through which the software of our genetics and the ideas sort of propagate.

It would mean the cultural equivalent of a gene, cultural equivalent in the sense of that which plays the same role as the gene in the transmission of culture and the transmission of ideas in the broadest sense. And it's a useful word if there's\n\nin the broadest sense. And it's a useful word if there's something Darwinian going on. Obviously, culture is transmitted, but is there anything Darwinian going on? And if there is, that means there has to be something like a gene, which becomes more numerous or less numerous in the population. So it can replicate? It can replicate. Well, it clearly does replicate. There's no question about that. The question is, does it replicate in a sort of differential way in a Darwinian fashion?

So most of the for profit companies have come to this conclusion\n\nthat owns a pharma company. And the mission of that pharma company is to maximize not profit, but maximize benefit for society. Yeah, yeah. Although there still will be profits, and the profits that we're gonna make are going to be used towards the mission of MAPS, which is again, is this mass mental health and ending the drug war. And in fact, we've hired the Boston Consulting Group to help us plot our commercialization strategy. And so there is some suggestions based, there's so many different assumptions in this, the number of therapists that we train, the price that we set for the MDMA,\n\nQuestion: What are the two revolutionary things that the speaker wants to do with the money earned from selling MDMA?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What was the author's background before learning Python?", "answer": "The author was a graduate student studying biomedical engineering and had experience in taking information from satellites and doing data processing in MATLAB, Perl, and scripting on a VMS.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Fundamentally for that reason, well, several reasons, but it just hurts us. We're soft. So speaking of languages that empower you, so Python was the first language for me that I really enjoyed thinking in, as you said. Sounds like you shared my experience too. So when did you first, do you remember when you first kind of connected with Python, maybe even fell in love with Python? It's a good question. It was a process. It took about a year. I first encountered Python in 1997. I was a graduate student studying biomedical\n\nI could think about what I wanted to do. And then the syntax wasn't that far behind it, right? Now there are some warts there still. It wasn't perfect. Like there's some areas where I'm like, ah, it'd be better if this were different or if this were different. Some of those things got added to the language too. I was really grateful for some of the early pioneers in the Python ecosystem back, because Python got written in 91. That's when the first version came out. But Guido was very open to users. And one of the sets of users were people like Jim Huganen and David Asher and Paul Dubois and\n\nPython in 1997. I was a graduate student studying biomedical engineering at the Mayo Clinic. And I had previously, I'd been involved in taking information from satellites. I was an electrical engineering student used to taking information and trying to get something out of it, doing some data processing, getting information out of it. And I'd done that in MATLAB. I'd done that in Perl. I'd done that in scripting on a VMS. There's actually a VAX VMS system, they had their own little scripting tools around Fortran. Done a lot of that. And then as a graduate student, I was looking for something\n\nQuestion: What was the author's background before learning Python?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What did Microsoft do to Netscape regarding the default browser in Windows?", "answer": "Microsoft told Netscape that they would pull their Windows license if they shipped Netscape as the default browser.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Microsoft was also making Internet Explorer the default browser in Windows, which is called tying and antitrust law. And they were doing even more brutal things. There was a famous investor. He did very well on Google. So he's a billionaire, Ramshree Ram, and he was sales guy or head of sales at Netscape.

So they came in 1996 and 97, and they came into the third edition of the standard, which was final finalized in 1999. But at that point, Netscape had been sold to AOL which was a decent exit considering and had previously been mercilessly crushed. Netscape was selling the browser along with server software that it had acquired after its IPO and Microsoft was just underpricing it. So there was no way to compete with that. Microsoft was also\n\non people of Windows. We have Windows 10 boxes at home. We have some Windows 7 boxes or laptops we keep running to because we don't connect them to the internet generally. But once you have that operating system to hold, you can force Edge. And Apple did it with Safari too. It's not unique to Microsoft. That's sad. But distribution matters. And that's why I think IE was going to win. That's why everybody at Netscape felt we're doomed. This was something Michael Toy and Jamie Woodson were doomed.

And if there's one particle with the right mutation that can escape the antibody, that will emerge, right? So that's what happens with influenza virus, right? We vaccinate every year, and there are not a lot of people that get infected, so they get natural immunity. And then the virus is incredibly varied. It mutates like crazy. And in some person somewhere, there's one variant that escapes the antibody, which has been induced either by infection or vaccination. It can be both. And that drives\n\nbinding. You could simulate that. You could say, what is the antibody looking at? Where antibodies bind on proteins are called epitopes, right? You could map them all and change them in a simulation one by one and go back and forth between the antibody and the virus. So all these, evolution is what we call an arms race, right? The virus changes and then it evades the host and then the host can change. The host takes longer to change though, unfortunately. It takes geological time, but it can. And then the virus can change and it can go back and forth. And we can see evidence of this in genome\n\nout and getting ready to be attached to the ACE2 receptors. However, there was a recent mutation that people studied in that spike protein. And very recently, a group from UMass Medical School will happen to collaborate with groups. So this is a group of Jeremy Lubin and a number of other faculty. They actually solve the mutated structure of the spike. And they showed that actually, because of these mutations, you have more than one arms opening up. And so now, so the frequency of two arms going up increase quite drastically. Interesting.

One interpretation is that we've lost our attention spans to our phones, people can't concentrate on a page if it takes them a minute to read, we're too busy watching TikToks or whatever people do. The other interpretation would be that language and verbal communication has, as well as some amount of communication, which is done through facial expression, tone of voice, et cetera.

I mean, as you pointed out, and this is another valuable observation in Stack Overflow, you can be super proficient in, for example, C Sharp, which I was working in. That's what we built Stack Overflow in and still is written in. And then switch to Ruby, and you're a newbie again. But you have the framework. I know what a for loop is. I know what recursion is. I know what a stack trace is. I have all the fundamental concepts to be a programmer. I just don't know Ruby. So\n\nAnd I think that's interesting.

Because we can surely do better than we do today. You've said that it's good for any professional programmer to know at least five languages as speaking about a variety of languages that you've taken inspiration from, and you've listed yours as being, at least at the time, C++, obviously, Java, Python, Ruby, script. Can you first\n\ncode for ARM or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there. And then even higher level than that, you're looking at Python, Ruby, interpreted languages. And then, to me, as a programmer, I'm like, OK, I want to go even higher. I want to go higher than that. How do I abstract higher than the language? It's like, well, you abstract in spoken language and written language, right? You're sort of inspiring people to get things done, giving them guidance, like, what if we did this? What if we did this? You're writing in the highest level language that there is, which is, for me, English, whatever\n\nQuestion: What programming language did the speaker use for the Stack Overflow project?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the reason why autocrats love fixed elections and social media?", "answer": "Autocrats love fixed elections and social media because it helps them solve an information problem and avoid rebellion in their own country due to uncertainty and distorted information.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And so there's a whole cottage industry of political science sort of talking about like why autocrats love fixed elections and why they love Twitter and why they actually like it in a controlled way. It solves an information problem.

And they see elections as potentially being mechanisms by which the corrupt people can manipulate the system unfairly, as opposed to letting the people speak with their voice. They somehow figure out a way to manipulate the elections, to elect somebody like one of them Western revolutionaries. And so I think one of the beliefs that's important to the American system is the belief in the electoral system that the voice of the people can be heard in the various systems of government, whether it's judicial, whether it's... I mean, basically the assumption is that\n\nget it. And I think the reason kings are more likely to get it is that kings have a low time preference where they think about things for many generations. Whereas in a democratic system, your president is likely only going to be there for four years or eight years or 10 years or five years or whatever it is. So the only way that, you know, all humans are self interested. So the only way that your president in a democracy can provide for themselves is to maximize the amount of exploitation that they can do of the population during their brief stint.

To communicate over long distances, you need your wires to be microns wide, and it's the same thing for wave guides. Wave guides are essentially limited by the wavelength of light, and that's gonna be about a micron, so whereas compare that to an axon, the analogous component in the brain, which is 10 nanometers\n\nwire of usually an insulating material. So silicon, silicon nitride, different kinds of glass, just like in a fiber optic, it's glass, silicon dioxide. That makes it a little bit big. We wanna bring these down. So we use different materials like silicon nitride, but basically just imagine a rectangle of some material that just goes and branches, forms different branch points that target different subregions of the network. You can transition between layers of these. So now we're talking about building in the third dimension, which is absolutely crucial. So that's what wave guides are. Yeah,\n\nthat now semiconducting part. So that light source is the semiconducting part of a neuron. And that, so the neuron has reached threshold. It produces a pulse of light. That light then fans out across a network of wave guides to reach all the downstream synaptic terminals that perform this process themselves. So it's probably worth explaining what a network of wave guides is, because a lot of listeners aren't gonna know that. Look up the papers by Jeff Chiles on this one. But basically, light can be guided in a simple, basically wire of usually an insulating material.

There is something very strange about the night that thoughts and anxieties are not the same as they are in the waking day. They are worse, they are bigger. And I at least find that I am far more likely to catastrophize and ruminate at night about things that when I wake up the next day in the broad light of day, I think it's nowhere near that bad, man. What were you doing? It's not that bad at all. So to gain firstly, some rational understanding of my emotional state that's causing that insomnia was very helpful. The second\n\nis it to land on that? It seems impossible. Like for, for a civilian, I guess, like me, it just seems crazy that a human can do that. The problem with night is, and there's different degrees of night, just like day. I mean, there's the clear full moon night, you know, where it's like, woo, you know, this is not that bad, but you got to remember at night, I think everyone can associate with you're driving in your car and it's just a, it's, it's an overcast dark night and you're on a country road with no side lights. Most people have a tendency to slow down just by nature of, Oh my God. Because\n\nnight things. Cause we're basically what we talk about at night. And I just, I go through them.

But it's, but I basically go through with Max and Augie, what are the things that are most important in life? Right.

So a lot of times in these regimes, unfortunately, it's very difficult for people to build that democratic society afterwards. Some people have told me that when you live in a totalitarian or authoritarian regime, it's kind of like a political desert. What grows in the desert? Scorpions and cacti, right?

Sure, so I mentioned the classical mechanics and the Euler Lagrangian formulation. One of the next important milestones for physics were the discoveries of laws of electricity and magnetism.

And he noticed that when he put these discoveries that Faraday's and others had made about electric and magnetic phenomena in terms of mathematical equations, it didn't quite work.\n\ndon't reduce them to something simpler. You take those for granted. You've got some laws that connect them. Here is how mass and space and time evolve.

And if you can't explain one thing, in terms of the previous fundamental things, you have to expand. Maybe something like this happened with Maxwell. He ended up with fundamental principles of electromagnetism and took charge as fundamental because it turned out that was the best way to\n\nthrough space at a speed that he could calculate. So he calculated the speed of the wave and lo and behold, he found it's the same as the speed of light, which puzzled him because he didn't think light had anything to do with electricity and magnetism. But then he was courageous enough to say, well, maybe light is nothing but these electric and magnetic fields moving around.

This is like the 1.0 that you want to release because if you hold it back any longer to polish it, you're denying others the ability to use it. It's like pro engineer, the mechanical CAD tool embedded the code, they embedded the layout engine. And Mozilla 1.0 was like\n\nthey embedded the layout engine. And Mozilla 1.0 was like a Netscape communication suite. We had at that point gotten male people to reintegrate mail and news and we had an editor for HTML. And it felt like a 90s suite, suiteware. And it felt kind of bloated. And the people who were taking that Mozilla open source and then adding Netscape flavor to it were not calling the shots right. And they were also under AOL's thumb a little bit and that they said, well, we should probably put the AOL instant messenger chicklet on the toolbar. We should put the ICQ, the other messaging system that AOL had\n\n4, which was based on the old code. Mozilla was trying to react to the code to make greenfield for developers. So it was one of my big goals. It wasn't a technical goal so much as again, a social goal. People wanted a more standard spaced browser. They wanted less of a hairball that had been hacked on by ex grad students starting four years prior. So we said, we're gonna make a modular code base. We're gonna use a variant or an open source version of Microsoft's component object model, has reference counting and standardized V tables, virtual calls and C++. And we're gonna use JavaScript.\n\nQuestion: What was Mozilla 1.0 like?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the analogy used to describe the copy and paste feature in Google Docs and Word?", "answer": "The analogy used is applying source formatting or applying destination formatting.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

So for digital entities, it's an interesting question. I think such a limit maybe should exist. But maybe it's going to be imposed by energy availability because this also consumes energy. In fact, most systems are more inefficient than we are in terms of energy required.

I think that my takeaway would be that we should work on general algorithms. And actually, I think that this idea of needing to better automate the acquisition of experience in the real world actually follows pretty naturally from Rich Sutton's conclusion.

And other animals will use tools, but they don't evolve the tools they use. They keep using the same\n\nAll right, Aristotle, you know, gives us the idea of humans as rational animals. You know, we're homo sapiens. But not the only game in town got Joseph Heusinger, an anthropologist in the 20th century. He called us homo ludens that were basically fundamentally playful creatures. And I think it was Hannah Arendt, homo faber, were tool making creatures. Another woman, Ellen Dizanayake, wrote a book called Homo Aestheticus. And following Aristotle and his poetics, she's like, well, we're not only rational animals, we're also aesthetic creatures that appreciate beauty. There's another take on\n\ncreatures that appreciate beauty. There's another take on humans. I think they call us homo narratans. We're storytelling creatures. And I think all of those designations of what it means to be human are quite useful heuristically and certainly worthy of our collective cogitation. But what garnered my attention when I was a young punk was just a single line in an essay by a Scottish guy, who was Alexander Smith, in a book called Dreamthwarp. I think it's written in the 1860s. He just says right in the middle of an essay, it is our knowledge that we have to die that makes us human.

He's an Austrian economist, an anarchist, and the author of The Bitcoin Standard and the new book, The Fiat Standard. Safety does not mince words in his criticism of economists and humans in general with whom he disagrees.

So he's, the O speaks enough, but he's one of the people that is perhaps most harshly criticized by folks in Austrian economics perspective and vice versa, which is a fascinating tension.

And that's the idea that goes further into C++, where I can get better types and more flexible types and more efficient types. But it's still the fundamental idea. When I want to write a program, I want to write it with my types that is appropriate to my problem and under the constraints that I'm under with hardware, software, environment, et cetera. And that's the key idea. People picked up on the class hierarchies and the virtual functions and the inheritance, and that was only part of it. It was an interesting and major part\n\nidea. Next comes the fact that you need to control copying because once you control, as you said, birth and death, you have to control taking copies, which is another way of creating an object. And finally, you have to be able to move things around so you get the move operations. And that's the set of key operations you can define on a C++ type. And so to you, those things are just just a beautiful part of C++ that is at the core of it all. Yes.

So these units are invisible. If you cannot detect them, you cannot target them. So they would just destroy your buildings or kill your workers.

If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n\nFor me, the answer is sort of clear because I start from the principle of modesty. You know, if we believe that we are alone and special and unique, that shows arrogance. My daughters, when they were infants, they tended to think that they are special, unique, and then they went out to the street and realized that other kids are very much like them. And then they developed a sense of a better perspective about themselves. And I think the only reason that we are still thinking that we are special is because we haven't searched well enough to find others that might even be better than us. And,\n\nI definitely, I mean, this is the thing I think everybody wrestles with to an extent, right? We are truly the protagonists in our own lives.

Every single person is special because you are that, the universe does, the world literally does revolve around you. That's the thing in some respect.

So there is this shared sort of objective reality, but sorry, there's objective reality that is\n\none of the things, one of the words we use to describe that. That's a really interesting way to put it. I don't think we need to be that defensive. I don't think anything good comes out of saying, well, we're somehow special, you know? Contrary wise, there are many examples in history of where trying to pretend that we're somehow superior to all other intelligent beings has led to pretty bad results, right? Nazi Germany, they said that they were somehow superior to other people. Today, we still do a lot of cruelty to animals by saying that we're so superior somehow, and they can't feel pain.\n\nQuestion: What is the natural bias that makes us feel special?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the name of the robot that iRobot made for bomb disposal units in Iraq and Afghanistan?", "answer": "The robot is called Pacbot.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Cognitively, it's somehow easier to think all Russians, monsters, you know, all Russians, all whatever the particular like thing is that you're supposed to not like. It's easier somehow, weirdly. You'd think that'd be more difficult. Yeah, but I guess the lesson is if you give in to the easy solution, that's going to lead to detrimental longterm effects.

And so for that lack of awareness, when the effect is really strong, it's very difficult to do on both the researcher and the patient side. Yes, and sometimes they talk about triple blind. So the other part is the raters that evaluate the symptoms and before and after. So you ideally want triple blind. You want the patients, the researchers, and the evaluators of the outcomes, all of them, not to know what the drug, whether it was drug or placebo, and that's to reduce experiment or bias. And then you move\n\nof the human organism, which is so complicated. So it's very difficult to dissect, to get the strong effects. And when you're analyzing, when you have like raters, they're watching a video. Removing subjectivity from that is very, very challenging. Yeah, very much so. And so we came to this agreement with FDA though that we would use this independent rater pool. And so we learned in phase two again, that the double blind, there was no solution to the double blind problem. And both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency in the end agreed that the best design was therapy with inactive placebo\n\nsay, oh, that's probably, you got the active drug instead of the placebo. So the double blind is in theory is terrific, but in practice, it doesn't always work quite as well. And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches that they think are important to reduce bias. The first one is easy to do. It's called random assignment. So sometimes there are studies where you'll treat a bunch of people with something and some fraction of them will get better and some won't.

Well, because it's easier to want things than it is to make them. It's much easier to want a Ferrari than it is to make one.

So I'm going to slightly dodge that question and say that I think maybe actually it's the other way around is that studying robotics can help us understand how to put common sense into our AI systems. One way to think about common sense is that, and why our current systems might lack common sense is that common sense is an emergent property of actually having to interact with a particular world, a particular universe, and get things done in that universe. So you might think that, for instance, like an image captioning system, maybe it looks at pictures of the\n\nand that's what drives their actions. Maybe that's, you know, the right thing to do when you haven't seen data very nearby that tells you otherwise. I don't know, it's a very open question.

Whereas the systems we're building now don't have to do that. They can take some shortcuts. That's fascinating.

And there are good reasons for that. When you look back at your life work, what is a moment? What is a event creation that you're really proud of? They say, damn, I did pretty good there.

That mitigation decisions would probably necessarily be very sort of localized. Okay, our community is trying to figure out what are we gonna do? What's gonna happen? Like we see this with schools, like where I grew up in New Jersey, there's very localized school districts. So even though they had sort of really bad viral\n\nSo in the United States, we passed this CARES Act that was aimed at making sure hospital systems didn't go bankrupt in the early days of the pandemic. The couple of things they did, one was they provided incentives to treat COVID patients, tens of thousands of dollars extra per COVID patient. And the other thing they did is they gave a 20% bump to Medicare payments for elderly patients who are treated with COVID. The idea is that there's more expensive to treat them at the early days. So that did provide an incentive to sort of have a lot of COVID patients in the hospital, because your\n\nQuestion: What was the decision made by many Northeast states regarding COVID infected patients?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the hardest part of the inflow of new transistors?", "answer": "Designing collateral to take advantage of it and cope with it.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

So Stanford recently announced that they're going back to virtual, at least for some period of time in response to the, maybe you can clarify, but I think it's in response to the escalated, how would they phrase it? It's related to Omicron. And a few other universities are kind of like considering back and forth.

So Numba was, it started from a desire to have kind of a vectorized that worked. A vectorized was a tool in NumPy, it was released. You give it a Python function and it gave you a universal function, a ufunc that would work on arrays. So you get the function that just worked on a scaler. Like you could make a, like the classic case was a simple function that an if then statement in it. So sine X over X function, sync function. If X equals zero, return one, otherwise do sine X over X. The challenge is you don't want that loop peg one in Python. So you\n\nis you don't want that loop peg one in Python. So you want a compiled version of that, but the ufunc, the vectorized in NumPy would just give you a Python function. So it would take the array of numbers and at every call do a loop back into Python. So it was very slow. It gave you the appearance of a ufunc, but it was very slow. So I always wanted a vectorized that would take that Python scaler function and produce a ufunc working on binary native code. So in fact, I had somebody work on that with PyPy and see if PyPy could be used to produce a ufunc like that early on in 2009 or something\n\nslicing.

But what's great is that unlike sleeping pills, when you stop working with your therapist, those benefits last for years later. Whereas when you stop your sleeping pills, you typically have what's called rebound insomnia, where your sleep not only goes back to being as bad as it was before, it's usually even worse. For me, I think I found a number\n\nhave a function. The first, as we mentioned, creativity. The second is that dreams provide a form of overnight therapy. Dreaming is a form of emotional first aid. And it's during dream sleep at night that we take these difficult, painful experiences that we've had during the day, sometimes traumatic, and dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm. And it sort of just takes the sharp edges off those difficult, painful experiences so that you come back the next day and you feel better about them. And so I think in that sense, dreaming, it's not time that heals all wounds.

In the same way, thinking about your job as an idea generator in the engineering space is like, this is good for my performance.

And your throat does these daily gymnastics to keep everything but air out of the windpipe because you slip up once and you can die. You can choke, you laugh or speak while eating and it's curtains, unfortunately. So it seems like every aspect of the body when I was learning about it in med school seemed so brilliant and so perfectly designed by evolution or whoever you might think designed it to favor survival, to enhance life, but the throat seemed the opposite. It seemed set up almost for failure. And we\n\nbloodstream and the other aspect of it secretes digestive enzymes into the gut to help you digest and absorb food. The liver is like 15 organs in one. It's just amazing how many different things it does. But the throat, so basically the problem with the throat is as I said, we have two tubes that are right next to each other in the throat. One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot, whatever you're gonna swallow, all of that stuff must go down the esophagus, the food tube and end up in the stomach. And right next to the esophagus millimeters away is the windpipe or the trachea, which goes\n\nit out and get rid of it. We even have something called the mucus elevator in our lungs, which is this constant flow of mucus up the airways, up to the trachea, dragging with it all kinds of particulates that we've inhaled and perhaps some food that went down the wrong pipe and drags it up into the throat and we swallow it kind of unconsciously all day, every day is the truth. Even the mechanism of swallowing is super complicated. It uses a number of cranial nerves. It uses over 15 different muscles. It's this coordinated act to keep food out of the airway.

If you think about the fact that some of us are more likely to get a certain disease than others because we have more variations in our genome that are causative of the disease, maybe fewer that are protective of the disease. People have quantified that using what are called polygenic risk scores, which look at all of the variations in an individual person's genome and add them all up in terms of how much risk they confer for a particular disease. And then they've put people on a spectrum of\n\ndisease. And then they've put people on a spectrum of their disease risk. And for certain diseases where we've been sufficiently powered to really understand the connection between the many, many small variations that give rise to an increased disease risk, there's some pretty significant differences in terms of the risk between the people, say at the highest decile of this polygenic risk score and the people at the lowest decile. Sometimes those differences are factor of 10 or 12 higher. So there's definitely a lot that our genetics contributes to disease risk, even if it's not by any stretch\n\ncontributes to disease risk, even if it's not by any stretch the full explanation.

There is definitely signal in the genetics and there's even more signal, we believe, in looking at the cells that are derived from those different genetics because in principle, you could say all the signal is there at the genetics level.

Yes, and then if you pick like two patches of the scene that has an intersection, and for humans, if you segment patch A and patch B, and then you look at the segmentation results, and especially if you look at the segmentation results at the intersection of the two patches, they should be consistent in the sense that what the label, what the pixels in this intersection,\n\nQuestion: What do we know about the human visual cortex?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the importance of making the early steps frictionless?", "answer": "Frictionless early steps are important because any friction point can cause people to lose interest and not continue on the journey of learning programming.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

You know, nothing escapes from them, but they create a violent environment where gas moves close to the speed of light and therefore shines very brightly, much more than any other source in the sky. And we can see these quasars all the way to the edge of the universe. So we have evidence now that when the universe was, you know, about 7% of its present age, you know, infant, already back then you had black holes of a billion times the mass of the sun,\n\nand said, you have an ulterior motive for sending us into a black hole, which I didn't deny, but at any event. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Can you say why we know that black holes exist? Right. So it's an interesting question because black holes were considered a theoretical construct. And Einstein even denied their existence in 1939. But then in the mid 1960s, quasars were discovered. These are very bright sources of light, 100 times brighter than their host galaxy, which are point like at the center of galaxies. And it was immediately suggested by Ed Salpeter in the West and by Yakov\n\nsuggested by Ed Salpeter in the West and by Yakov Zeldovich in the East, that these are black holes that accrete gas, collect gas from their host galaxy that are being fed with gas. And they shine very brightly because as the gas falls towards the black holes, just like water running down the sink, the gas swirls and then rubs against itself and heats up and shines very brightly because it's very hot close to the black hole. By viscosity, it heats up. And in the case of black holes, it's the turbulence, the turbulent viscosity that causes it to heat up. So we get these very bright sources of\n\nQuestion: What is a quasar and why is it so bright?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is the healthy version of competition according to the speaker?", "answer": "The healthy version of competition is when people strive together to build each other up.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

It's about you enjoying the process of having a competition and not knowing whether you're gonna win or lose this little thing. But then also being aware that, you know, what's the boundary? How big do I want competition to be? Because one of the reason why Moloch is doing so well now in our society, in our civilization is because we haven't been able to ring fence competition.

And when it reaches its threshold, which occurs by driving a Joseph's injunction above its critical current, it produces a pulse of current, which starts an amplification sequence, voltage amplification, that produces light out of a transmitter.

One is when they're in a condition of severe starvation. The second is when they're caring for their newborn. So for example, killer whales will often deprive themselves. The female will go away from the pod, give birth, and then bring the calf back. And during that time, the mother will undergo sleep deprivation. And then the third one is during migration when birds are flying trans oceanographic 2,000, 3,000 miles. But for the most part, it's never seen in the animal kingdom, which brings me back to the point, therefore\n\nnow is the following. One of the few times that I mentioned before that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep or prolonged sleep deprivation is under conditions of starvation. And that is an extreme evolutionary pressure. And at that point, the brain will forgo some. It won't forgo all, but it will forgo some of its sleep. And the reason is so that it can stay awake for longer because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain, you can't find food in your normal foraging perimeter, you need to stay awake for longer so you can travel outside of your perimeter for a further distance\n\nanswer that question then? So I think one of the ways that I think about this or one of the answers that came to me is the following. The reason that we implode so quickly and so thoroughly with insufficient sleep is because human beings seem to be one of the few species that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent good reason, biological. And what that led me then to was the following. Mother nature as a consequence. So no other species does what we do in that context.

As the scale increased, we lost the ability to do that. Now, as you mentioned, the internet could change that. The fact that we had representatives that had to ride a horse from one town hall to the other one to see what the colony would do, that we stopped having this kind of developmental propositional development process when the town hall ended. The fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is somewhere between insane and aligned with class interests.

So basically Fermi was part of the Manhattan Project. So he was in New Mexico when they exploded the first atomic bomb and so he was a couple of miles away from the explosion and he was probably one of the first persons to calculate the energy of the explosion. And so the way he did that was he took a piece of paper and he tore down a piece of paper in in little pieces and when the bomb exploded the Trinity bomb was the name of the bomb like he waited for the blast to arrive at where he was and then he threw those pieces\n\nQuestion: What was the Manhattan project and why was it important?\nHelpful Answer:"}, {"question": "What is unique about the consumer electronics and hardware manufacturer ecosystem in Shenzhen?", "answer": "It is the only place in the world that makes sense to make complex consumer electronics at large scale and low cost.", "question_with_context": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

And so Locke was right maybe in 1690 that the world was large and had infinite resources. He's certainly wrong today, in my opinion. Also wrong is the claim that the unlimited pursuit of personal wealth does not harm those around us. There is no doubt that radical inequality is tragic psychologically and physically. Poverty is not that terrible. It's easy for me to say because I\n\npoint is that the allure of money is that it's basically a concentrated symbol of wealth, but because it doesn't spoil, Locke said, you're entitled to have as much money as you're able to garner. Then he says, well, the reality is that some people are more, the word that he used was industrious. He said some people more industrious than others. All right, today we would say smarter, less lazy, more ambitious. He just said that's natural. It's also true. Therefore, he argued, over time, some people are going to have a whole lot of property and other people not much at all.

And the question is exactly the cost of forgetting at the very edge of stuff that could be important or could not be, how do we remember or not those things?

And the amount of current that you add is an analog value, can have eight bit equivalent resolution, something like that. 10 bits, maybe. That's amazing, by the way. This is starting to make a lot more sense. When you're using superconductors for this, the energy of that circulating current is less than the energy of that photon.

And so curing the disease in the animal, which in most cases doesn't happen naturally, mice don't get Alzheimer's, they don't get diabetes, they don't get atherosclerosis, they don't get autism or schizophrenia.

But as you start to drink more and more coffee, the body tries to fight back and it happens with many different drugs by the way, and it's called tolerance. And so one of the ways that your body becomes tolerant to a drug is that the receptors that the drug is binding to, these sort of welcome sites, these sort of picture myths, as it were, that receive the drug, those start to get taken away from the surface of the cell and it's what we call receptor internalization.

And we talk about, in a certain region of space, a certain number of degrees of freedom, a certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that region can arrange themselves. That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite. We actually don't know how many there are, but there's a very good argument that says it's a finite number.

But if it's a\n\ndegrees of freedom making up space time. And as the universe expands, there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuits. So what does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become more entangled? Yeah, so. As the universe expands. That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom that are entangled, that are playing part, playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure. So the basic, the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the\n\nmatter. Infinity times two is still infinity. But if it's a finite number, then there's more space, so there's more degrees of freedom. So where did they come from? That would mean the universe is not a closed system. There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence. So what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom, and it's not that they're not there to start, but they're not entangled to start. So the universe that you and I know of, the three dimensions around us that we see, we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space time.

And to make that work, you have to change your view of how space and time work to be able to account for the fact that when you're going faster, it appears that length is foreshortened and time is dilated and things like this. And that's special relativity. That's special relativity. So then Einstein went on with sort of vaguely similar kinds of thinking. In 1915, invented general relativity, which is the theory of gravity. And the basic point of general relativity is it's a theory that says, when there is mass in space,\n\nnot moving, you get the speed, it's just you always get the speed. So Einstein was very puzzled and he was daring enough to say, well, you know, maybe everybody gets the same speed for light. And that motivated his theory of special relativity. And this is an interesting example because the idea was motivated from physics, from Maxwell's equations, from the fact that people try to measure the properties of ether, which was supposed to be the medium in which the light travels through. And the idea was that only in that medium, the speed of, if you're at risk with respect to the ether, the\n\nof mathematics that explains special general relativity can map nicely to describe fundamental property of the hypergraphs, the curvature of the hypergraphs.

Okay, so first I have to explain, what we're explaining is, first thing you have to have is a notion of dimension. You don't get to talk about curvature of things.

That's really clean, those are great terms. Integrity and confidentiality. Right. So how, what are the main vulnerabilities to privacy, would you say, and how do we protect against it? Like what are the main spaces and problems that you think about in the context of privacy? Right, so especially in the machine learning setting. So in this case, as we know that how the process goes is that we have the training data and\n\nan example showing that's why even as we train machine learning models, we have to be really careful with protecting users data privacy. So what are the mechanisms for protecting? Is there hopeful? So there's been recent work on differential privacy, for example, that provides some hope, but can you describe some of the ideas? Right, so that's actually, right. So that's also our finding is that by actually, we show that in this particular case, we actually have a good defense. For the querying case, for the language model case.

Usually they correspond to a physical system that has two very well separated states. And then other kinds of computation, like we'll get into more the way your brain works, which it is, I think, indisputably processing information, but where the computation begins and ends is not anywhere near as well defined. It doesn't depend on these two levels. Here's a zero, here's a one. There's a lot of gray area\n\non the right, and very few electrons in the middle, and you do this by changing the concentration of different dopants in the lattice spatially. And then when you apply a voltage to that gate, you can either cause current to flow or turn it off, and so that's sort of your zero and one. If you apply voltage, current can flow, that current is representing a digital one, and from that, from that basic element, you can build up all the complexity of digital electronic circuits that have really had a profound influence on our society. Now you're talking about electrons. Can you give a sense of what\n\nHere's a zero, here's a one. There's a lot of gray area that's usually referred to as analog computing. Also in conventional digital computers or digital computers in general, you have a concept of what's called arithmetic depth, which is jargon that basically means how many sequential operations are performed to turn an input into an output. And those kinds of computations in digital systems are highly serial, meaning that data streams, they don't branch off too far to the side. You do, you have to pull some information over there and access memory from here and stuff like that.

Isn't that amazing? Yeah. So that's altering the behavior. Altering because somehow the virus infecting the plant cells gives off these organics and attracts aphids. And furthermore, somehow when the aphid bites, it tastes horrible. So they immediately leave with the virus they've just picked up and go to another plant to spread it.

It's almost the speaking about modern times in the same voice as you speak about when you talk about history. So it was just a little bit of a haunting view of the world today.

The test, the way the machine works, it goes through cycles and every cycle it amplifies what you put in and the more cycles you need to see something, that means there's not a lot of RNA there. So if you do a test and you have a cycle threshold of 35, you have very little RNA in you. Contrary, if you have a cycle threshold of 10, you have a ton of RNA and it only took 10 cycles to detect it. And you can extrapolate from that number, the number of copies you have per sample, say per swab. And if you don't have a million, you're not infectious. You're not gonna infect\n\nright? And a common mistake that many people who should know better, physicians and scientists of all kinds, they think that indicates how much virus you have. It doesn't.
